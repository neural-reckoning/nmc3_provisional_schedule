        <h1>Replication of two computational models of locomotion of Caenorhabditis elegans in Brian 2</h1><h2>Ivan Estevez</h2><h3>Francisco J. Valverde-Albacete, Carlos III University of Madrid; Carmen Peláez-Moreno, Carlos III University of Madrid</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a simple nervous structure yet displays complex behaviours
mediated by a sensation-action loop. We report on replicating two experiments based on two different
models of the locomotion neural circuits of C. elegans [1, 2].

Both articles present point-neuron models that consider the graded nature of the electrical activity
in C. elegans, as opposed to spiking-neuron models—yet both are different. In the first case a
non-dimensional model is used for a small subnetwork in which the values of free parameters are
found by applying constraints with a genetic algorithm. The second model is based on physiological
parameters for cells and synapses, therefore no optimization is needed and almost the complete
connectome of C. elegans is simulated—279 out of 302 neurons. The replications are performed in the
simulating platform Brian 2, which is available as a Python module and is different from the
original methods used.

We were able to verify the main hypothesis proposed by each article. In the first case, the
production of intrinsic network oscillations by central pattern generators (CPGs) along the ventral
nerve cord of the worm. In the second, the existence of a bifurcation in the model state-space
produced by a constant sensory input that creates oscillatory behaviour. Nevertheless, we were
unable to replicate exact quantitative results for the first model, and obtained contradictory
results when performing neural ablations on the second network model. The source code generated, and
data used are made publicly available in code repositories [3].
