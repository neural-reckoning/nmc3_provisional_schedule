        <h1>Predicting attentional engagement during narratives and its consequences for event memory</h1><h2>Hayoung Song</h2><h3>Emily S. Finn, Dartmouth College; Monica D. Rosenberg, University of Chicago</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>As we comprehend narratives, our attentional engagement fluctuates over time. Despite theoretical conceptions of narrative engagement as emotion-laden attention (Bilandzic et al., 2019, Int. J. Commun.), little empirical work has characterized the cognitive and neural processes that comprise subjective engagement in naturalistic contexts or its consequences for memory. Here, we relate fluctuations in narrative engagement to patterns of brain coactivation, and test whether neural signatures of engagement predict later recall. First, in two behavioral experiments, participants rated how engaged they were as they watched an episode of the television show "Sherlock" (n=17) or listened to an audio-narrated story, "Paranoia" (n=21), by continuously adjusting a scale bar on a computer monitor. Self-reported engagement was synchronized across individuals, and the emotional content of the narratives was correlated with engagement when controlling for low-level stimulus features. We next analyzed functional MRI data collected as separate participants watched the same Sherlock episode (Chen et al., 2017, Nat. Neurosci.) or listened to the same story (Finn et al., 2018, Nat. Commun.). In these participants, group-average engagement drove neural synchrony, such that default mode network activity was more synchronized across individuals during more engaging moments of the narratives. Furthermore, time-resolved predictive modeling revealed that dynamic functional brain connectivity, but not BOLD activity patterns, predicted evolving states of engagement. Models not only predicted engagement of novel individuals within a single data set, but also generalized across completely independent samples. Finally, the same functional connections that predicted engagement overlapped with a validated neuromarker of sustained attention (Rosenberg et al., 2016, Nat. Neurosci.) and predicted post-scan free recall of the narratives, suggesting that engagement during memory encoding impacts subsequent event memory. Together, our findings reveal a robust and generalizable neural signature of engagement dynamics and elucidate relationships between narrative engagement, sustained attention, and event memory.</p>
