        <h1>Temporal regularity is an essential social cue in mouse vocal communication</h1><h2>Catherine Perrodin (she/her)</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Animals navigating the real world continuously face large amounts of complex sensory information. One of the strategies used by the brain to perceptually compress multidimensional input is to selectively extract the features relevant for behaviour and survival. Like humans and many other mammals, mice communicate using acoustically complex vocal sequences. However, little is known about what acoustic information listeners monitor and use from these sensory streams during social interactions. 
Here, we utilized female miceâ€™s natural behavioural response to male courtships songs to identify the relevant acoustic dimensions used by listeners in their social decisions. Using playbacks of intact and acoustically manipulated songs in an ethologically-relevant assay, we evaluated the behavioural relevance of several candidate acoustic features in mouse communication.
We found that female listeners were highly sensitive to disruptions of song temporal regularity and preferentially approached playbacks of intact male songs over rhythmically irregular versions of the songs. In contrast, female behaviour was invariant to manipulations affecting the global structure of the song, such as randomized sequential organization and song temporal reversal. Similarly, manipulating the local spectro-temporal structure of individual syllables, such as phase-scrambling or pure tone approximation, did not influence female behaviour to male song playback.
Our findings highlight temporal regularity in vocal sequences as a key acoustic cue extracted by listeners during natural vocal-directed behaviour. By identifying which acoustic dimensions in vocal sequences are behaviourally-relevant, respectively less informative, to listeners, this work frames ongoing electrophysiological investigations into the neuronal substrates supporting the perception of vocal sequences.
