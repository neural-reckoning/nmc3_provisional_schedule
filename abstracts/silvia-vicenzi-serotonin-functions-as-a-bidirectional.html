        <h1>Serotonin functions as a bidirectional guidance cue regulating growth cone motility</h1><h2>Silvia Vicenzi</h2><h3>Lisa Foa ; Rob Gasperini</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The neurotransmitter serotonin is implicated in a range of mental health disorders that are associated with altered neuronal connectivity during development. Remarkably, serotonin is synthesized and secreted in the embryonic brain prior to the formation of most synapses, thus before neural circuits become fully functional. This suggests serotonin could regulate neuronal connectivity through a process known as axon guidance, which enables neurons to form accurate connections. Growth cones, the leading tips of neurons, are guided in the developing brain by instructive molecules called guidance cues that enable neurons to reach and connect to their targets. We hypothesized that serotonin acts as a novel guidance cue, regulating growth cone motility and hence, axon guidance during early stages of brain circuit formation. Using a growth cone motility assay and a range of pharmacological tools, we found serotonin acts bimodally, attracting and repelling growth cones, through the binding to specific serotonin receptors 5HT2a and 5HT1b, respectively. Using high resolution imaging of growth cones exposed to microgradients of serotonin, we showed serotonin-induced bidirectional motility is underpinned by two distinct signalling mechanisms: 5-HT2a-induced attraction is mediated by calcium release, while 5-HT1b-induced repulsion is driven by cAMP signalling. Optogenetic manipulation of 5-HT2a signalling altered growth cone trajectories away from serotonin, further demonstrating the specificity of secreted serotonin as an axon guidance cue. Unravelling how serotonin functions to regulate the normal wiring of the brain will allow us to better understand how dysfunction in serotonin signalling during development could contribute to the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
