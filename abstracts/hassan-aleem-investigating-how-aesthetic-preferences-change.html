        <h1>Investigating How Aesthetic Preferences Change Over Time</h1><h2>Hassan Aleem</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Everyday experience suggests that our aesthetic preferences change throughout the course of our lives, sometimes quite abruptly. However, much of the existing research surrounding aesthetic preferences does not consider the impact of such changes. Understanding how and why our preferences may change over time is important not only for fields such as neuroaesthetics, marketing, and neuroeconomics, but for cognitive sciences overall. Here, we investigated how aesthetic preferences for different colored shirts, cars, and phone cases changed over a 4-week period. We measured changes in preferences for these three categories on a weekly basis. Our results showed that aesthetic preferences tended to drift further from their initial starting point as time went on. This effect was consistent for all three categories. We further found that aesthetic stability tended to increase as a function of age, but did not differ across sex. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate aesthetic preferences across multiple timepoints as well as categories. Our findings show that aesthetic preferences are not stable even at a weekly interval, stressing the importance of understanding how these changes may be reflected in existing experiments as well as in other domains of cognitive science.</p>
