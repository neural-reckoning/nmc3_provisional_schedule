        <h1>Parallel pathways of odor processing in the lateral entorhinal cortex</h1><h2>Sebastian Bitzenhofer</h2><h3>Sebastian H. Bitzenhofer, Center for Neural Circuits and Behavior, Department of Neuroscience, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA; Jeffry S. Isaacson, Center for Neural Circuits and Behavior, Department of Neuroscience, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, USA</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Layer II principal cells in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) receive olfactory sensory input from the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex and relay this information to the hippocampus. Distinct types of layer II cells direct information via two parallel pathways: fan cells send direct projections to the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells project to CA1. However, little is known about the role of the LEC in the processing of odor information. Here we use acute optogenetic silencing in head-fixed mice performing two-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) tasks to show that the LEC is necessary for rapid (<300 ms of odor inhalation) discrimination of odor identity and intensity. Consistent with these rapid behavioral responses, simultaneous silicon probe recordings in the awake state from the LEC and hippocampus reveal that virtually all olfactory-evoked activity occurs in a brief time window coupled to odor inhalation. Using brain slice recordings, we show that direct input from the olfactory bulb preferentially targets LEC fan cells, whereas input from the piriform cortex equally targets fan and pyramidal cells. This results in faster onset of odor evoked activity and more selective responses in fan cells, as well as better odor discrimination at the population level.</p>
