Increasing evidence reinforces a strong relationship between cholinergic failure, neurodegeneration, and cognitive deficits in AD. With aging, glial cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines that contribute to age-related neurodegeneration and deficits in brain function. Astrocytes play important roles in cognition and modulation of neuroinflammation, but their role in AD remains unknown. Recent observations suggest that cholinergic signaling, via acetylcholine, regulates cognitive processing and hippocampal function, partially by signaling in astrocytes. Signaling via the Gq protein-coupled M3-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3Gq), known to elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration, to astrocytes can trigger the release of glial modulators favoring hippocampal plasticity. Conversely, Gi protein-coupled M4-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M4Gi) signaling in astrocytes impairs remote memory recall and decreases brain activity. We hypothesize that activating muscarinic receptors modulates astrocyte activity and leads to changes in neuroinflammation and cognition. Our objectives are to determine whether we can modulate muscarinic G-protein signaling specifically in astrocytes, to determine the baseline effect of astrocyte muscarinic signaling activation on behavior and cytokine expression and to determine if this signaling plays a role in AD. We generated mice expressing either Gq(hM3Dq) or Gi(hM4Di) Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). These DREADDs are mutated receptors that longer respond to their endogenous ligand acetylcholine but are instead activated by Clozapine N-Oxide (CNO). We have confirmed that in both hM3Dq and hM4Di mice, DREADDs are expressed specifically in astrocytes. Activation of hM3Dq in cultured primary astrocytes, by CNO, increased intracellular Ca2+. Activation of global astrocyte Gi or Gq receptors do not show significant changes in motor activity or anxiety-like behavior. Future experiments will observe cognitive function tasks using touchscreen technology with acute and chronic activation of hM3Dq or hM4Di receptors and determine whether this signaling can regulate neuroinflammation. </p>
