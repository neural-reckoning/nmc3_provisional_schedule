        <h1>Abrupt transitions of response patterns emerging from gradual changes of network connectivity</h1><h2>Bastian Eppler</h2><h3>Dominik Aschauer, JGU Mainz; Simon Rumpel, JGU Mainz; Matthias Kaschube, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent experimental studies show substantial ongoing remodeling - even in the absence of an explicit learning paradigm - on both the level of synaptic connections [Loewenstein et al., 2011] and the level of neuronal population activity [Aschauer, Eppler et al., in review]. It is, however, unclear, how the changes in neuronal activity can be linked to changes in the underlying synaptic connectivity. 
To shed light on these phenomena we study a circuit model of randomly connected excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
For strong recurrent connectivity and a high ratio of inhibition to excitation, the model reproduces key characteristics of neuronal activity patterns of mouse auditory cortex, including sparse activity, a broad distribution of firing rates, and a clustering of stimuli into a set of response modes [Bathellier et al., 2012]. In this regime we also find that gradual changes of synaptic strength can result in periods of stable responses which are interrupted by abrupt transitions towards new response patterns. 
To understand the mechanism underlying these transitions, we analyze the fixed points of this network model, employing a method similar to [Sussilo and Barak, 2013]. 
The regime, where we find this clustering, is characterized by multiple fixed points per stimulus, i.e. one stimulus can evoke different responses depending on the initial conditions of the system. Analyzing how the fixed points of a network change during ongoing, random synaptic drift reveals that abrupt transitions of response patterns coincide with significant changes in the layout of fixed points. 
We conclude, that even slow ongoing synaptic changes can lead to abrupt transitions which can be inferred from the fixed point dynamics of the network.</p>
