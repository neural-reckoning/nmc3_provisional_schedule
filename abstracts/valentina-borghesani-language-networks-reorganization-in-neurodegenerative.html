        <h1>Language networks reorganization in neurodegenerative disorders: behavioral, structural, and functional evidence from semantic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia.</h1><h2>Valentina Borghesani</h2><h3>Borghesani, V., UdeM; Lukic, S., UCSF; Hinkley, L.B.N., UCSF; Licata, A., UCSF; Bogley, R., UCSF; Weis, E., UCSF; Welch, A., UCSF; Mizuiri, D., UCSF; Miller, B., UCSF; Miller, Z., UCSF; Houde, J.F., UCSF; Nagarajan, S.S., UCSF; Gorno-Tempini, M.L. UCSF;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a clinical syndrome in which patients progressively lose speech and language abilities due to neurodegeneration of left-hemisphere language networks. Three variants are recognized, associated respectively with phonology and/or short-term verbal memory deficits (logopenic variant), grammar and/or speech-motor deficits (nonfluent variant), or semantic deficits (semantic variant, or svPPA). svPPA patients manifest a deep, generalized, loss of semantic knowledge and relatively focal anterior temporal (ATL) lobe atrophy. 
Here, we capitalize on this unique clinical model and MEG recordings to investigate the spatiotemporal features of language networks and in particular the crucial role of the ATL in semantic processing. 
First, we show that svPPA patients over-rely on dorsal, occipito-parietal brain regions during irregular word reading. This evidence corroborates a dual-route model where reading aloud is mediated by the interplay between a ventral lexico-semantic system and a dorsal sub-lexical/phonological one.
Second, we find that, during a semantic categorization task, svPPA patients show greater activation over bilateral occipital cortices and superior temporal gyrus, as well as inconsistent engagement of frontal regions. These findings indicate a pervasive reorganization of brain networks in response to ATL neurodegeneration: defective semantic representations are compensated via enhanced perceptual processing (in occipital regions) and semantic control (in the fronto-parietal network).
Finally, we demonstrate that the error patterns in an auditory verb generation task depend on the breakdown of different neurocognitive mechanisms across PPA variants. Specifically, svPPA patients produce the highest percentage of unrelated-verb responses and the highest number of light verbs, providing additional evidence of the critical role played by the ATL in semantic processing.
Taken together, our findings have important implications for clinical phenotyping and differential diagnosis of PPA variants, as well as for theoretical model of the neurobiology of language.</p>
