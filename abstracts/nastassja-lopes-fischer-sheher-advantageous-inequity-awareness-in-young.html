        <h1>Advantageous inequity awareness in young children: the role of late positive potential (LPP) and emotional reactivity.</h1><h2>Nastassja Lopes Fischer (she/her)</h2><h3>Nastassja L. Fischer, National University of Singapore; Changrun Huang, National University of Singapore; Elizabeth B. Kim, National University of Singapore; Nawal Hashim, Duke-NUS; Jean Yeung, National University of Singapore; Rongjun Yu, National University of Singapore</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>“Inequity aversion” (IA) is the natural tendency to avoid unfair outcomes. IA can take two forms: disadvantageous inequity (DI) aversion (i.e. when one avoids receiving less than a peer), or advantageous inequity (AI) aversion (i.e. when someone denies receiving more than a peer). Usually DI aversion is prevalent since early ages, while AI aversion has an appearance in later developmental stages. Despite existing evidence about this topic from behavioural developmental studies, there is an increasing need to add a neurobiological perspective to bridge the gap between IA and its underlying neural processes. To better understand the relationship between this behaviour and emotional reactivity, we employed a Montecarlo approach with cluster-based permutation testing to analyze electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of seventeen 3- to 6-years-old children while they participated in a child-friendly Dictator Game (DG) task that included three types of offers: advantageous unequal (AI), disadvantageous unequal (DI) and fair (FA). After each offer, we asked children about their feelings. We observed that participants felt more sad with DI offers when compared to AI and FA offers. We also found higher late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes for AI offers when comparing to FA offers. These high LPP amplitudes after offer onset were related to the positive emotional responses to the offers. Therefore, we interpret that EEG amplitudes within LPP boundaries in pre-schoolers are an indicative of high emotional sensitivity to advantageous offers, which may explain the low levels of AI aversion in young children.</p>
