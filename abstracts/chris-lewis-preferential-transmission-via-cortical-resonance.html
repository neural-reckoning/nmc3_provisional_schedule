        <h1>Preferential transmission via cortical resonance</h1><h2>Chris Lewis</h2><h3>Chris Lewis, University of Zurich; Jianguang Ni, Ernst Strüngmann Institute; Thomas Wunderle, Ernst Strüngmann Institute; Patrick Jendritza, Ernst Strüngmann Institute; Andreea Lazar, Ernst Strüngmann Institute; Ilka Diester, Ernst Strüngmann Institute; Pascal Fries, Ernst Strüngmann Institute</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Synchronization has been implicated in neuronal communication, but causal evidence remains indirect. We used optogenetics to emulate synaptic inputs to cat visual cortex and measured spike output. Channelrhodopsin 2 generated currents through the somato-dendritic membranes of excitatory neurons under precise temporal control. Constant excitation was transformed into strong synchronization in the gamma-band, revealing the well-known cortical resonance. Ramp stimulation demonstrated that the resonant frequency varied (30-60 Hz) with excitatory input strength, and Gaussian excitation exhibited hysteresis of power and frequency. Crucially, white-noise sequences enabled a causal analysis of network transmission, establishing preferential transmission of input components that are coherent to the resonance. Models composed of recurrently coupled excitatory and inhibitory units uncovered a crucial role of feedback inhibition and suggest that hysteresis can arise from the non-inactivating M-current. The presented approach provides a means to investigate resonance properties of local circuits and how these properties transform input and shape transmission.</p>
