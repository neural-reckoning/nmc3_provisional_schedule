        <h1>Integrating Whole-Brain Neural Activity Data with Nonlinear and Connectome-Based Models of Neural Circuits for Prediction of Behavior in Freely Moving C. elegans</h1><h2>Mehmet Kerem Turkcan</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In the last few years, it became possible to image the activity of large numbers of neurons in freely behaving specimens and thus to collect data on neural dynamics and behavior simultaneously for a number of model organisms. Such data has been used to design data-driven models that can predict behavior from single neuron scale activity. However, today, these approaches often do not take the nonlinearity of the transformation between neural activity and behavior into account, and similarly do not consider how the connectome computationally enables the generation of this neural activity. We analyze the recently released data on freely moving C. elegans to demonstrate two approaches for attacking this problem: (i) we show that nonlinear models can achieve similar features as and better correspondence to held out data than linear models; (ii) we initialize connectome based neural circuit models and employ activity data to estimate activity in other neurons or the stimulus; we propose this as an approach for closing the gap between activity-based and connectome-driven models to move towards models that are more consistent with existing data and can generalize to different experimental settings.</p>
