        <h1>Learning orthogonalizes visual cortical population codes</h1><h2>Samuel W. Failor</h2><h3>Samuel W. Failor, University College London; Matteo Carandini, University College London; Kenneth D. Harris, University College London</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A body of work argues that learning results in an increased representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli in cortex; however, understanding how learning changes population codes requires simultaneously recording large neural populations. To clarify the effects of learning in primary visual cortex (V1), we recorded from thousands of neurons in V1 in response to passive drifting gratings before and after training on a novel orientation comparison task. 

In the task, two gratings were presented simultaneously, each one of three orientations (45°, 68°, and 90°). Mice were rewarded for choosing 45° or rejecting 90°. Thus, 45° and 90° informed what action the mouse should take while 68° was a distractor. 

Task training affected orientation tuning curves in unexpected ways: a reduction in the number of neurons preferring the informative orientations (45° and 90°), asymmetric tuning curves, and suppression of responses to both informative orientations, most notably for weakly tuned neurons. 

These multifarious effects on tuning curves could be explained by a simple principle: sparsening of the population for informative orientations. This increase in population sparseness orthogonalized the population codes for informative stimuli to each other and to all other orientations (i.e., increased the angle between the population rate vectors). 

To elucidate the possible biological mechanism underlying these learning effects, we developed a simple computational model, in which a top-down “importance signal” modulated neuronal F-I curves.  This model, which does not necessitate Hebbian-like plasticity, could successfully recapitulate the myriad impacts of learning on single-cell tuning curves by increasing population sparseness through F-I curve modulation. 

Our results show that learning sparsifies the representation of informative task stimuli in the brain, orthogonalizes their population codes, and may improve their differentiation by downstream regions of the brain.
