        <h1>Supralinear networks with short-term plasticity can account for transient neuronal dynamics in the olfactory system</h1><h2>Yue Kris Wu</h2><h3>Rainer W. Friedrich, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research; Friedemann Zenke, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The olfactory system is widely believed to implement an autoassociative memory network capa- ble of generating similar representations in response to chemically distinct but functionally related odorants. Classic autoassociative memory models rely on strong recurrent excitatory connec- tions accompanied by attractor dynamics, which exhibit persistent activity even after removing the stimulus. However, multiple experimental studies in the mammalian piriform cortex and in the te- lencephalic area Dp of zebrafish have revealed that odor stimuli evoke transient responses with a precise excitation-inhibition balance. This balance implies that neural circuits may operate as inhibition-stabilized networks during stimulation. Here, we studied how transient responses can arise in networks with supralinear transfer functions by analyzing their behavior in response to external inputs. We found that transient responses can arise when network dynamics switch from stable to unstable by additional afferent inputs and are eventually re-stabilized through short-term plasticity mechanisms. We identified E onto I short-term plasticity as the most promising mech- anism in this process. By contrast, both spike-frequency adaptation and E onto E short-term plasticity were inconsistent with specific aspects of experimental data. In summary, we provide a modeling framework that accounts for transient neuronal dynamics in the olfactory system, which could be applied to other sensory systems.</p>
