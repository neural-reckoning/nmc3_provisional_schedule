        <h1>Value-based decision making in naturalistic vs laboratory settings</h1><h2>Angelo Pirrone</h2><h3>Fernand Gobet, London School of Economics and Political Science</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>What defines a decision making experimental paradigm as “value-based”? We argue that a number of key features that characterise value-based decision making in naturalistic settings - the types of choices that our brains have evolved to optimise - are greatly overlooked in empirical research in decision making, especially in the experimental setup commonly used in value-based decision making research in laboratory settings, in both psychology and neuroscience. In this talk, we will present the naturalistic constraints that are common to virtually all value-based decisions outside of laboratory settings. Furthermore, we will discuss how failing to include such ecological constraints has important implications for our understanding of decision making. Finally, in view of these claims, we discuss possible new research questions for the future. </p>
