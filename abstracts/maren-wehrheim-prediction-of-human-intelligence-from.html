Fiebach, Department of Psychology Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Germany, Brain Imaging Center Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Germany; Kirsten Hilger, Department of Psychology Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Germany, Julius Maximilian University Würzburg Germany; Matthias Kaschube, Department of Computer Science and Mathematics Goethe University Frankfurt am Main Germany, Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies Frankfurt am Main Germany;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Spontaneous interactions between brain regions contain pertinent information about the neural bases of human behavior and cognition. Previous studies predicting cognitive abilities like intelligence have mostly focused on time-averaged (static) brain connectivity, derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Recent work decomposed dynamic brain connectivity into states of high and low co-fluctuation and demonstrated that only a small fraction of high co-fluctuation states is sufficient to approximate the general structure of the brain’s functional network architecture. Of note, such high co-fluctuation states have been shown to capture information that uniquely identifies individuals suggesting their relevance for stable individual differences in behavior and thought. Here, we use fMRI resting-state data (N = 281) to test whether the 5% of time points that index the moments of highest co-fluctuation can predict individual levels of general intelligence (WASI, Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence). To this aim, we developed the Covariance Maximizing Eigenvector-Based Prediction framework (CMEP) that combines eigendecomposition-based feature construction with cross-validated ElasticNet prediction. The constructed features identify brain-wide patterns of network interactions reflecting a linear relationship between functional brain states and individual variations in intelligence. Surprisingly, functional connectivity reconstructed from highest co-fluctuation states could not reliably predict intelligence (correlation observed vs. predicted IQ scores: r = 0.14; p = 0.06). In contrast, functional connectivity reconstructed from the remaining 95% time points (excluding highest co-fluctuations) yields a significant prediction of intelligence (r = 0.38; p < 0.001). Finally, we reveal a different strategy for selecting critical time points and show that significant prediction of intelligence is indeed possible with only 5% resting-state fMRI data. The results are replicated in a completely independent sample (N = 831) and we conclude that the analysis of spontaneous brain network interactions may contribute to further understand individual differences of human cognition.</p>
