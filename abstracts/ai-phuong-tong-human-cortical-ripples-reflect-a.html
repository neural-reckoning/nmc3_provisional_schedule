        <h1>Human cortical ripples reflect a spectrum of synchronous spiking activity across spatial scale</h1><h2>Ai Phuong Tong</h2><h3>Ai Phuong S. Tong, NIH; Alex P. Vaz, NIH, Duke; Sara K. Inati, NIH; Kareem A. Zaghloul, NIH</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Engagement of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and neocortex in episodic memory is strongly associated with increases in high frequency activity (HFA). Recent evidence suggests that discrete HF oscillations termed ripples are linked to memory processes. While increases in HFA during successful memory retrieval has been widely observed, the dynamic changes within individual trials are less clear. We hypothesized that resolving increases in HFA in time can reveal discrete ripple events that reflect a spectrum of dynamic spiking activity coupled to low frequency (LF) oscillations. Twenty-one participants completed a paired-associates verbal memory task in which they studied word pairs and were later cued with a word from each pair while we recorded intracranial EEG (iEEG). Six of these participants had simultaneous microelectrode array recording of single-unit spiking activity. We extracted spectral power from the iEEG signal using Morlet wavelets between 1-200 Hz. We defined discrete HFA events as ripples when 80-120 Hz spectral power exceeded two SDs for a minimum of 25 ms. Ripples were detected from simultaneous macroscale iEEG and microscale local field potential (LFP) recordings. Synchrony of discrete events were measured using pairwise phase consistency (PPC). Increases in HFA during successful memory retrieval were correlated with ripples within trials (p<0.0001). Amplitude of iEEG ripples was correlated with amplitude, number, and synchrony of LFP ripples across MEA electrodes (p<0.05). Furthermore, amplitude of LFP ripples was correlated with spiking activity and number of spiking units (p<0.05). Spike-LFP PPC was significant between 4-8 Hz and 80-120 Hz during ripples in correct memory retrieval. LFP ripple-iEEG PPC was also significant between 4-8 Hz, suggesting that spiking activity during ripple events are coordinated by theta at the microscale and macroscale (p<0.001). Overall, our data suggest that successful memory retrieval exhibits discrete ripples across spatial scale that reflect a spectrum of synchronous spiking activity. </p>
