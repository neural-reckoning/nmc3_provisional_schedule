        <h1>Altered amygdala functional connectivity across Schizo-Bipolar spectrum and facial emotion recognition</h1><h2>Jiaxu Han</h2><h3>Victoria Okuneye, The University of Chicago; Sarah Keedy, The University of Chicago</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Research purpose: Previous research has consistently reported facial emotion recognition deficits across the schizo-bipolar spectrum. Though its neural mechanism is still not well understood, there is evidence suggested altered functional activity in the amygdala in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders during facial emotion tasks. The current study aims to compare the amygdala resting-state functional connectivity between patients across the schizo-bipolar spectrum and healthy controls as well as its correlation to the behavioral performance of a dynamic facial emotion recognition task (DARE). Method: Subjects were selected from a multi-site study (BSNIP) and they completed the DARE task and a resting-state fMRI scan. After removing scans with poor quality and excessive motion, the current study included a total of 346 subjects (healthy control: 126; schizophrenia: 84; schizoaffective disorder: 104; bipolar disorder with psychosis: 32). Amygdala was chosen as a region of interest (ROI) given its role in emotion processing, as well as reported changes in this region in the schizophrenia population in previous research. Age, gender, motion, and scanner sites were included as predictors of no interests. Results: Compared to healthy controls, there was a significantly (p-FWE<0.01) decreased functional connectivity to the right amygdala in the right insula and right planum polare in the patient group. Additionally, there was a significantly (p-FWE<0.01) decreased functional connectivity to the left amygdala in the left and right insula, right planum polare, and right supramarginal gyrus in patients compared to controls. However, amygdala functional connectivity was not significantly correlated with the overall facial emotion recognition accuracy in the DARE task. </p>
