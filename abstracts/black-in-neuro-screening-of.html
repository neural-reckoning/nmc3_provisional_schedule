Film Synopsis:
Coded Bias explores the fallout of MIT Media Lab researcher Joy Buolamwiniâ€™s startling discovery that facial recognition does not see dark-skinned faces accurately, and her subsequent journey to push for the first-ever US legislation to govern against bias in artificial intelligence. The documentary aims to shine a light on the threat artificial intelligence poses to civil rights and democracy.</p>
