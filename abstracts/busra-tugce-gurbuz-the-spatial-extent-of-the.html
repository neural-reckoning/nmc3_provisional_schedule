        <h1>The spatial extent of the tilt aftereffect</h1><h2>Busra Tugce Gurbuz</h2><h3>Huseyin Boyaci, Bilkent University, National Magnetic Resonance Research Center (UMRAM)</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The tilt aftereffect (TAE) is observed when the perceived tilt of oriented contour changes due to adaptation to another orientated contour.  So far, the TAE has generally assumed as a local aftereffect observed only at the adapted location. Here, we challenged this main assumption and investigated how the TAE spreads across different spatial locations. 
Using a peripheral adapter, we measured the TAE magnitude at 15 peripheral locations while participants were fixating on a central fixation point. Adapter grating was always presented at the same spatial location with 10.5° eccentricity to the central fixation point. In contrast, test gratings were presented randomly at 15 test locations within the same visual hemifield, including the adapter location, and two 1-up-1-down staircases determined their orientations. Participants indicated the test gratings' perceived tilt by pressing the right or left arrow key on a keyboard. The control condition was identical to the experimental condition except for adaptation. The subjective verticality (SV) of the test grating was determined by fitting a logistic regression function to the data. The TAE magnitude was calculated by subtracting the control condition's SV from the experimental condition's SV.
We found that the TAE is a non-local aftereffect that spreads across the whole visual hemifield  (N=19, p<0.05) except one location (down-row, 2.5° eccentricity, p=0.472).  To explain the computational mechanisms underlying this spread, we simulated a population of orientation-tuned neurons with different receptive fields (RFs). Based on the gain-reduction model of adaptation, we hypothesized that adaptation would decrease tuning-curves' and RFs’ sensitivity and trained our model with human data to explore how this reduction happens. Our trained-model could predict human data with 70% accuracy and provide supporting evidence for the gain-reduction model.
