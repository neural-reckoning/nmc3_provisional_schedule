        <h1>Online Replication of Age Effects in Two Variants of the Mnemonic Similarity Task</h1><h2>Jack-Morgan Mizell</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Performance on The Mnemonic Similarity Task (MST) has been shown to be sensitive to age-related changes in medial temporal lobe function. The traditional MST has participants see a set of images during an encoding phase and then test their memory for these images in a test phase where participants must judge whether the images they are seeing are repetitions of previous images, similar images to those they saw, or completely new images. Age-related changes have been shown to relate to the ability to discriminate similar images (Lures) from previously seen images. This sensitivity has led to widespread use of the task, and several of its variants to probe age-related changes within the temporal lobes. However, whether these effects replicate in an online setting are currently unknown. 

In this study we used two online versions of the MST-Objects version (MST-O)  on an online sample of Older and Younger adults. Using both paradigms, we replicate previously reported age effects in the online setting. Specifically, and in line with lab-based studies, we see age-dependent effect on lure discrimination, while finding no such age effect on recognition abilities. Additionally, we were able to replicate a similarity-dependent effect on Lure Discrimination, where the more similar a Lure is to its original image, the less likely it is to be correctly identified, regardless of age group. We were also able to show that behavior in both tasks correlate across both online versions, showing that we are able to capture some meaningful individual differences. Both online versions of the MST-O captures similar behavior, and age-related differences to the lab-based experiments which opens up the potential for using the MST on larger and more diverse samples than are typically possible in lab-based experiments.
