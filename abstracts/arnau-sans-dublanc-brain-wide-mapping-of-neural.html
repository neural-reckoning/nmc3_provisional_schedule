In mice, the superior colliculus is comprised of a set of cell-types that each innervate distinct downstream targets. Here we reveal the networks downstream of four collicular cell-types by combining functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) with optogenetics to monitor whole-brain activity at a resolution of ~100 ‎μm. Each neuronal group activated distinct, partially overlapping sets of brain nuclei. This included regions not previously thought to mediate defensive behaviors. Electrophysiological recordings support the fUSi findings and show that neurons in the downstream nuclei preferentially respond to innately threatening visual stimuli. This work provides insight into the functional organization of the networks governing defensive behaviors and demonstrates an experimental approach to explore the whole-brain neuronal activity downstream of targeted cell-types.</p>
