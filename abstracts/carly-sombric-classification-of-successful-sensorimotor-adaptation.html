        <h1>Classification of Successful Sensorimotor Adaptation in Locomotion</h1><h2>Carly Sombric</h2><h3>Carly Sombric, University of Pittsburgh; Rayid Ghani, Carnegie Mellon University; Gelsy Torres-Oviedo, University of Pittsburgh</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Introduction: Split-belt walking could serve as an intervention to correct hemiparetic gait due to brain lesions, such as stroke. However, not all participants respond similarly to the same split-belt protocol and it is unclear how to tailor the split-belt training for a given individual. Thus, there is a basic science and clinical interest to predict if a given protocol will be successful for a specific subject. <br/><br/>Methods: We applied classification algorithms on an assembled large dataset (N=690 samples) of split-belt experiments to identify subject demographics (e.g., age, BMI, etc.) and protocol details (e.g., length of training, walking speed, etc.) strongly influencing whether a specific protocol would result in “good” or “poor” sensorimotor adaptation for a given individual.  A numerical approach was taken where many classifiers were trained and tested (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.) on different subsets of the database with different model parameters. Performance metrics were computed (e.g., precision, recall, etc.) for each classifier type, subset of the data, and parameters for the classifier. For the performance metrics mentioned, a value closer to one indicates better classification performance than a value closer to zero. <br/><br/>Results: The best and most robust classifiers (e.g., consistent and high performance across different subsets of the data) had acceptably good performance as indicated by an average classification accuracy of 85% (average precision = 0.93, average recall = 0.81). Of the features used, baseline gait asymmetry (even for non-clinical subjects) and belt speed difference, rather than belt speed ratio, were identified as important for predicting a protocol’s success. <br/><br/>Conclusion: This work suggests that machine learning tools could be used to guide subject-specific rehabilitation interventions. The results of this work provide basic science and clinical insight into what aspects of split-belt gait training are important for different populations to successfully learn a new walking pattern.</p>
