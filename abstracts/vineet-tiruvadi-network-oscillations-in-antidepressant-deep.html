        <h1>Network Oscillations in Antidepressant Deep Brain Stimulation</h1><h2>Vineet Tiruvadi</h2><h3>Vineet Tiruvadi</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown use in treating severe psychiatric depression but we don't know how it works when it works. Using modern neural recording interfaces we can study short- and long-term oscillatory changes in the brain related to DBS and to depression. I will present empirical work inferring depression severity from chronic neural oscillations and characterizing the immediate effects of DBS on whole-brain network oscillations. I'll then present a separate thread of computational work, consistent with empirical observations, that seeks to model antidepressant DBS as a control-affine system with both predictive and biophysical dynamics. This work provides a clearer view of how (and where) antidepressant DBS changes brain oscillations and sets a data-congruent foundation for more rational clinical improvements.</p>
