        <h1>Transmitter switching contributes to two environmental models of  neurodevelopmental disorders</h1><h2>Swetha Godavarthi</h2><h3>Nicholas C Spitzer, University of California San Diego</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Early environmental factors play a key role in emergence of neurodevelopmental disorders and cortical neurotransmitter imbalance is a convergent phenotype seen across different types of disorders. Neurotransmitter switching involves loss of one transmitter and gain of another often changing the sign of the synapse from excitatory to inhibitory or vice versa and altering behavior (Spitzer, 2017). We are testing the hypothesis that transmitter switching contributes to these disorders in mouse models. We treat pregnant females with either Poly Inosine:Cytosine (Poly I:C) or valproic acid (VPA)  at embryonic day E12.5 and assess the progeny for molecular and behavioral changes.
    Both treatments cause a transient decrease of 6000 GAD67+ neurons and an equal increase of vGluT1+ neurons in the mPFC at postnatal day (P)10 in experimental mice compared to controls that disappears by P90. These changes do not result from altered number of precursors or apoptosis and occur specifically in PV+ and CCK+ neurons. P90 animals demonstrate enhanced stereotypy and deficits in social interaction compared to controls.  
    Stereotaxic injection of P9 PV-Cre/CCK-Cre Poly I:C-treated mice with Cre-dependent HSV-GFP revealed vGluT1+GFP+ neurons in the neonatal mPFC at P13 demonstrating expression of vGluT1 in a subset of PV-Cre/CCK-Cre neurons, providing evidence for transmitter switching in single neurons.
    To test the role of the transmitter switch in emergence of behavioral deficits, we stereotaxically injected P9 male and female PV-Cre/CCK-Cre mice with Cre-dependent HSV-GAD1-GFP. This restored GAD67+GFP+ neurons in PV and CCK cells in experimental mice and prevented gain of vGluT1 in GFP+ neurons by P13 unlike Poly I:C-treated controls injected with HSV-GFP. Restoring GAD67 also rescued altered behavior in P90 experimental male mice. Our results add to growing evidence that alteration in signaling in the nervous system during the early stages of its construction can be detrimental to the function of the mature brain.</p>
