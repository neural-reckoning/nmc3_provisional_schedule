        <h1>Visual Misrecognition Reveals Contradiction between Lower and Higher Visual Cortex Activations</h1><h2>Mohamed Abdelhack</h2><h3>Yukiyasu Kamitani, Kyoto University and ATR</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>One trait that distinguishes human vision from artificial vision model is its relative robustness under conditions of uncertainty. It is generally believed that the immense connectivity between different visual areas allowing bottom-up, recurrent, and top-down connectivity patterns allows this trait. However, the integration mechanism that occurs between signals that pass through those connections is a big open question. To investigate this question, we use the concept of visual misrecognition under challenging conditions. This setting allows us to investigate the conditions when behavioral response does not match the visual content and how the brain responds to perception correction. We recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging signals while subjects watched blurred images of various difficulties. We then decoded the image category through a deep neural network proxy. We found that neural signals in the lower visual areas did not point to the same categories as the higher visual areas. The lower areas rather matched the actual existing stimulus signals while the deeper areas decoded categories matched those chosen by the subject. Additionally, higher visual areas appeared to point to the wrong category when subjects made a mistake but showed to switch direction after subjects corrected their choice as the blur level decreased following the subjectsâ€™ behavior consistently. These results reveal the dynamics of the higher visual areas as they switch their representation in response to additional visual data which could shed a light on their connectivity patterns.</p>
