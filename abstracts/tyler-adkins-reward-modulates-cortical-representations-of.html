        <h1>Reward modulates cortical representations of action</h1><h2>Tyler Adkins</h2><h3>Tyler Adkins, University of Michigan Department of Psychology; Taraz Lee, University of Michigan Department of Psychology.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>People are capable of rapid improvements in action performance when they are presented with large prospective incentive cues. The neural mechanism by which this performance enhancement occurs remains unclear. We investigated this phenomenon by offering prospective offers of monetary reward to human participants, contingent on their successful production of sequential actions. We found that people executed cued actions more quickly and accurately when they were offered large rewards. Reward offers were associated with elevated activity throughout the brain and fine-grained patterns in these regions encoded information about future action. Follow-up analyses provided evidence that action-coding in action preparation regions of the frontal lobe enhanced by reward and related to subsequent performance. This work sheds light on the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the incentive-motivated performance of action, suggesting that it may depend critically on the fidelity of prospective action representations in the frontal lobe.</p>
