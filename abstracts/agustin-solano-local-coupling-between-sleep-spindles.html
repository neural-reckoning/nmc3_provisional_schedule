        <h1>Local coupling between sleep spindles and slow oscillations supports consolidation of visuomotor adaptation</h1><h2>Agustin Solano</h2><h3>Agustín Solano, IFIBIO Houssay-University of Buenos Aires; Luis A. Riquelme, IFIBIO Houssay-University of Buenos Aires; Daniel Perez-Chada, IFIBIO Houssay-University of Buenos Aires; Valeria Della-Maggiore, IFIBIO Houssay-University of Buenos Aires</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The last decade has seen remarkable progress in the identification of the neural signatures of sleep-dependent consolidation. Yet, with rare exceptions, most advances have emerged from the field of declarative memory. This imbalance may obey to the substantial evidence suggesting that only hippocampal dependent tasks benefit from sleep. Overnight reactivation of hippocampal memories appears to depend on the precise synchrony between slow oscillations (SO) and sleep spindles. Here, we sought to examine whether this coupling is also critical for the consolidation of human motor memories. <br/>	We hypothesized that if the level of coupling between SO and spindles is also critical for the consolidation of motor memories then it should predict long-term memory overnight. Given that the role of sleep in sensorimotor adaptation is somewhat controversial, in Experiment 1 (n = 46) we tested this hypothesis by manipulating the proximity between visuomotor adaptation (VMA) and sleep. This procedure has been implemented successfully for declarative memories. We found that sleeping immediately after learning increased memory retention by 35% compared to sleeping 14 hours later (p<0.05), an effect that persisted for at least two weeks. Next, in Experiment 2, we sought to identify the neural signatures supporting sleep consolidation of visuomotor adaptation. To this end, a new set of subjects (n = 10) were exposed to a VMA session or a control session in which no perturbation was applied (CTL), and went to sleep 10 min later. We found that adaptation to a visual rotation increased the density of spindles during NREM3 over the electrodes contralateral to the trained hand (p=0.05). This effect was mostly driven by the electrodes placed over the left sensorimotor cortex. Although visuomotor adaptation did not affect the density of SOs (p>0.05), it substantially modulated the spindle-SO coupling in an inter-hemispheric manner (p<0.001), suggesting it may rather increase the ability of slow oscillations to promote thalamic spindles. Critically, spindles associated with a SO predicted long-term memory overnight, whereas uncoupled spindles didn’t.<br/>	In conclusion, we have shown that sleep modulates the consolidation of visuomotor adaptation by increasing the level of coupling between spindles and slow oscillations in an inter-hemispheric manner during NREM3 sleep. Our findings provide compelling evidence for a role of the spindle-SO coupling in the stabilization of motor memories, and open the possibility of a common mechanism at the basis of procedural and declarative memory.</p>
