        <h1>Tracking Rhesus Macaque in a semi-naturalistic social enclosure (SNSE)</h1><h2>Felipe Parodi</h2><h3>Felipe Parodi, University of Pennsylvania; Konrad P. Kording, University of Pennsylvania; Michael L. Platt, University of Pennsylvania</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>An open question in the study of non-human primates is that of relating naturalistic behavior to neural recordings or manipulations to better understand brain function. One way in which we can record naturalistic behavior is through markerless pose estimation. Advances in deep learning have largely improved human pose-estimation algorithms; however, tracking freely moving animals in naturalistic, three-dimensional (3D) environments remains comparatively understudied. The main challenge to successful pose tracking in non-human primates, such as the rhesus macaque, is attaining a sufficiently large and reliably annotated training set, rather than developing the algorithm itself. Here, we take advantage of two recently published training sets, OpenMonkeyPose and MacaquePose, to train a model that reliably tracks the poses of one to two rhesus macaques in a semi-naturalistic social enclosure (SNSE) with DeepLabCut, an efficient tool for high-throughput video analysis. Looking ahead, we aim to integrate wireless optogenetic manipulations and neurophysiological recordings to control behaviorally meaningful volumes of the primate brain in animals free of any physical restraint, permitting the causal dissection of the neural circuits that mediate naturally-occurring primate behaviors relevant for understanding social cognition. </p>
