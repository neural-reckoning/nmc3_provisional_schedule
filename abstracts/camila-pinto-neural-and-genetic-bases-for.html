Current attempts are often narrowly defined and lack a comprehensive basis. However, a better definition of a basis for human ability would be invaluable since neuropsychiatric disease diagnoses and symptom severity are commonly related to such differences in performance. Here, we use the framework of the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox, which provides a unified assessment of neurologic and behavioral function to identify four underlying ability traits within the NIH Toolbox normative data (n = 1369): 1: Motor-endurance, 2: Emotional processing, 3: Executive and cognitive function, and 4: Social interaction. Using the Human Connectome Project young adult dataset (n = 778) we showed that two traits, Motor-endurance and Executive and cognitive function were reliably associated with specific brain functional networks (r^2=0.305Â±0.021). Moreover, we showed the biological nature of these ability traits by calculating their heritability (31% and 49% respectively) from twin data.<br/>Therefore, we characterize human ability using the NIH Toolbox as a framework. Looking forward, this framework allows us to determine connections between the trait space and clinical outcomes in different neurophysiological conditions, such as chronic pain.<br/></p>
