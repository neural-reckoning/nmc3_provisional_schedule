        <h1>Oxytocin and embryonic diapause</h1><h2>Jessica Minder</h2><h3>Moses Chao; Robert Froemke</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>We have examined prenatal oxytocin receptor expression in the mouse embryo, detecting the oxytocin receptor as early as embryonic day four, during the blastocyst stage. This is the developmental stage where blastocysts begin implantation into the uterine endothelium, an event critical for successful pregnancy. Interestingly, rodents- like most if not all mammals- undergo a phenomenon called diapause, in which the timeframe that the embryo implants is delayed during a maternal state unfavorable for pregnancy, such as while nursing a previous litter (Fenelon et al., 2014). Embryonic diapause is thought to occur by making the uterus non-receptive to implantation in a manner regulated by the hypothalamic neuroendocrine axis, but the underlying mechanism is unknown (Renfree and Shaw, 2000). Lactation requires the neuropeptide oxytocin, raising circulating levels of oxytocin that can permeate down to the embryo, perhaps via maternal-fetal signaling (Stouffer and Hennebold, 2014). 

We hypothesize that oxytocin, released in response to the sensory stimulus of a suckling pup, might act to initiate diapause in mice. In support of this, we have recapitulated a developmental delay in vitro using a cell culture model of blastocyst implantation (Bedzhov et al., 2014), in which the time for mouse blastocysts to implant is delayed by 12 hours in the presence of oxytocin, as compared to saline-treated blastocysts (p-value:0.0087). Using patch-clamp electrophysiology, we have elucidated that oxytocin may be functioning to signal entry into diapause within the embryo by reducing the overall conductance of the mouse blastocyst to initiate developmental pausing until conditions are favorable for pregnancy progression. 

In addition to examining diapause in vitro, we are using chemo- and opto- genetics to activate oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus of mothers in the absence of the nursing to ask if oxytocin release is sufficient for diapause induction. Furthering our understanding of the uterine conditions favorable for allowing blastocyst implantation and the mechanisms by which the mouse blastocyst integrates cues from its surroundings to dictate developmental timelines has major implications for neuroendocrine signaling, developmental biology, and reproductive medicine.
