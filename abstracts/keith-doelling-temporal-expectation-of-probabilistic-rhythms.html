        <h1>Temporal expectation of probabilistic rhythms</h1><h2>Keith Doelling</h2><h3>M. Florencia Assaneo, Instituto de Neurobiologia, UNAM; Luc Arnal, Institut Pasteur; David Poeppel, New York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The environment surrounding the human brain is full of rhythm and temporal regularities which can be extracted to improve perception and ultimately survival. Many studies have suggested that neural oscillations may be a candidate mechanism for processing and predicting such rhythms particularly in the auditory domain. However, such studies are often limited by a narrowing scope, studying only perfectly isochronous rhythms that are unlikely to be found in the natural world (cf. speech). How might such an oscillatory mechanism behave in a more probabilistic rhythmic environment? We designed a behavioral experiment to study how humans make predictions under these more ambiguous conditions. Participants listen to a train of tones drawn from gaussian distribution around perfect isochrony and report whether the final tone is early or late relative to their expectation. We found that the method for calculation of temporal expectation depends critically on the stimulus rate (from 1 Hz â€“ 4 Hz). We compared our behavioral results with two models of temporal prediction at different levels of explanation: a Wilson-Cowan model of oscillatory behavior from a neural perspective and an ideal observer Bayesian model. Our analysis studies the potential (if any) for oscillatory behavior to be used as a mechanism for a rhythmic prior in the Bayesian sense even under uncertain rhythmic scenarios</p>
