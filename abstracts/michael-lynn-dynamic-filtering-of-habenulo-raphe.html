        <h1>Dynamic filtering of habenulo-raphe inputs by a recurrent inhibitory serotonin network acting over behavioral timescales</h1><h2>Michael Lynn</h2><h3>Michael Lynn, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa; Sean Geddes, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa; Mohamad Chahrour, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa; Sebastien Maillé, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa; Emerson Harkin, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa; Samir Haj-Dahmane, Research Institute on Addictions, University at Buffalo; Richard Naud, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa; Jean-Claude Béïque, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The habenulo-raphe pathway is believed to be implicated in orchestrating optimal behavioral responses to aversive, threatening or stressful environments. Here, we consider how long-range inputs from lateral habenula (LHb) influence circuit dynamics in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) using electrophysiological, computational and behavioral strategies. We find that habenulo-raphe afferents triggered classical monosynaptic excitation of 5-HT neurons, as well as strong disynaptic inhibition whose induction was steeply frequency-dependent and which persisted for seconds. This novel inhibition was mediated by a GIRK conductance activated by 5-HT1A receptors. To determine the network motifs underlying this protracted inhibition, we undertook optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations in DRN. These experiments revealed, unexpectedly, that 5-HT neurons are organized in a recurrent inhibitory network, refuting the classical model of autocrine activation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Electrical stimulation approaches revealed that these inhibitory connections exhibited robust, dramatic short-term facilitation that we formalized with a linear-nonlinear plasticity model. To examine how this nonlinearity affects input-output transformation, we constructed an experimentally-constrained network model of DRN which incorporated the experimentally-fitted plasticity model at inhibitory connections. We find that excitatory inputs led to paradoxical inhibition of DRN at high frequencies, and that this polarity switch was dependent on plasticity dynamics and not on recurrent inhibition itself. To test the physiological relevance of this computation for processing threat information from the LHb, we developed a simple auditory classical conditioning paradigm and tested key predictions of our model through in vivo optogenetics. We uncovered a nonlinear transformation where stimulating the habenulo-raphe pathway at high-frequency, but not at low frequency, depressed goal-directed anticipatory licking behavior. We suggest that the computation sustained by this circuit motif in the DRN categorizes synaptic inputs to implement optimal adaption of behavioural policies in threatening environments.</p>
