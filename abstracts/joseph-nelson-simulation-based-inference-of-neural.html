        <h1>Simulation-based inference of neural models from large-scale single-neuron electrophysiology</h1><h2>Joseph Nelson</h2><h3>Tom Chartrand </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Mechanistic models are useful tools in neuroscience for testing whether proposed mechanisms are consistent with experimental data. Further, biophysically-detailed neural models can help infer parameters that are not easily measurable, such as ionic channel densities. Recent advances in likelihood-free statistical inference have given neuroscientists the opportunity to use both these biophysically-detailed models and statistical inference in their analyses. We test a new inference tool, which incorporates these recent advances, on the Allen Institute Cell Types Database. Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) is a tool for fast identification of model parameters consistent with both a chosen prior distribution and experimental data. SNPE trains an artificial neural network on synthetic data, using this trained network to estimate the posterior distribution of model parameters from experimental data. Previous studies have tested SNPE on a homogenous set of experimental protocols. For this study, we explore the viability of SNPE in a different context, by testing SNPE on a more diverse set of experiments. Our test dataset is derived from surgical samples from the human brain, with neurons tested adaptively at different current levels. To accommodate this diverse dataset, we use high-level features that generalize across experimental sweeps, rather than features from a particular neuron's voltage trace. We simulate two neural models, with parameters drawn from an informed prior distribution, and compute these high-level features from this synthetic data. With these synthetic features and SNPE, we conduct amortized simulation-based inference (SBI) on our dataset. We find that our amortized SBI across this dataset produces models inconsistent with the electrophysiological data, using both a reduced and conductance-based model. These inconsistent results show the difficulties of using SNPE in this new context, the sensitivity of SBI to feature selection, and the challenge of selecting a prior. </p>
