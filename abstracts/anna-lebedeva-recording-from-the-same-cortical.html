        <h1>Recording from the same cortical neurons over months with Neuropixels probes</h1><h2>Anna Lebedeva</h2><h3>Nicholas Steinmetz, University of Washington; Marius Pachitariu, Janelia Research Campus; Jai Bhagat, UCL; Kenneth Harris, UCL; Matteo Carandini, UCL; Michael Okun, University of Leicester</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>For many studies, especially those focusing on learning and plasticity, it is important to track the activity of neurons over prolonged periods. Prolonged recordings can be achieved with two-photon imaging, but this method is difficult in deep brain structures and has limited temporal resolution. Here we asked whether neurons could be reliably tracked across recordings with Neuropixels probes, which allow access not only to the cortex but also to deep brain structures and can resolve individual spikes. We implanted mice with novel Neuropixels 2.0 probes that can have one shank or four shanks, and have more tightly spaced recording sites compared to commercially available Neuropixel 1.0 probes. We implanted the probes vertically through primary visual cortex and cemented them to the cranium. For recordings, mice were head-fixed in front of computer screens. Recordings were performed at regular intervals. Recordings yielded many neurons across >6 months, but there was substantial drift across sessions. To compensate for it, we used a modified version of Kilosort2 algorithm. To characterize the neurons, during each recording we presented a library of natural images. Many V1 neurons responded to these images and showed a pattern of preferences that constituted a unique signature. Using this signature we followed the activity of these neurons over the course of days, weeks and months. The ability to follow large populations of individual neurons over extended periods opens new possibilities in the study of learning and plasticity.</p>
