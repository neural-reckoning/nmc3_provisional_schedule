        <h1>Neuromodulation enhances plasticity in a rat model of cochlear implant use</h1><h2>Erin Glennon</h2><h3>Angela Zhu, NYU School of Medicine; Mario Svirsky, NYU School of Medicine; and Robert C. Froemke, NYU School of Medicine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Rates of auditory perceptual learning with cochlear implants are highly variable across patients. Adaptation to cochlear implants is believed to require neuroplasticity within the central auditory system. However, mechanisms by which behavioral training enables plasticity and improves outcomes are poorly understood. Here we hypothesize that neural mechanisms promoting plasticity in the rat auditory system are key to optimizing cochlear implant usage. Specifically, we examined the effect of pairing locus coeruleus stimulation with an auditory stimulus on auditory learning when the animal has to relearn a tone identification task (self-initiated, go/no-go) using a cochlear implant. Initial training was done using acoustic stimuli in normal hearing animals. Animals were then bilaterally deafened, unilaterally cochlear-implanted, and retrained with the new target delivered by intracochlear electrical stimulation.  Prior to daily behavioral training sessions, rats underwent 5-10 min pairing sessions either with optogenetic locus coeruleus or sham stimulation. Pairing accelerated learning with cochlear implants. We then conducted multi-unit recordings in the auditory cortex to assess responses to the cochlear implant. Animals that had been trained with the cochlear implant had increased activation of the cortex, and those that underwent pairing had a sharper representation of the target cochlear implant channel. We used fiber photometry to monitor activity of noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons. During auditory learning, cochlear implanted animals display dynamic locus coeruleus activity, specifically during the acquisition of the meaning of reward relevant tones. These studies indicate that neuromodulation can play a powerful role in shaping outcomes with cochlear implant use and training.</p>
