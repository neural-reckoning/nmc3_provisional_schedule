        <h1>Systematic review and meta-analysis of the calibration of confidence judgments in individuals with schizophrenia</h1><h2>Martin Rouy</h2><h3>Pauline Saliou, Université Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LPNC UMR 5105, Grenoble, France; Ladislas Nalborczyk, GIPSA-lab, CNRS, Grenoble, France; Michael Pereira, Université Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LPNC UMR 5105, Grenoble; Paul Roux, Université Versailles Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, Centre Hospitalier de Versailles; Nathan Faivre, Université Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LPNC UMR 5105</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: Metacognitive deficits are well-documented in schizophrenia as a decreased capacity to adjust confidence to first-order performance in a given cognitive task. However, because metacognitive ability directly depends on first-order performance, the observed metacognitive deficits may partly be driven by lower first-order performance. Thus, we hypothesized that studies controlling for first-order performance find smaller metacognitive deficits in schizophrenia.
Method: We conducted a meta-analysis of 43 studies comparing the calibration of confidence in 1458 individuals with schizophrenia compared to 1337  matched controls with a Bayesian model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regressions were performed to explore how metacognitive deficits depend on task performance, cognitive domains, clinical severity, and treatment dosage.
Results: We found a smaller metacognitive deficit in schizophrenia among studies equating first-order performance between groups. Plus, the metacognitive deficit in non-controlled studies was correlated with first-order performance. No correlations were found between metacognitive deficit and clinical features of schizophrenia.
Conclusion: We provided evidence that the metacognitive deficit in schizophrenia is inflated due to non-equated first-order performance. Thus, efforts should be made to develop experimental protocols accounting for lower first-order performance in schizophrenia.
