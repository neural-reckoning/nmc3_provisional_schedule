        <h1>Vagolytic effect of Zolpidem on Sleep-dependent Memory: A Trade-off between Working Memory and Long-term Memory</h1><h2>Pin-Chun Chen</h2><h3>Hamid Niknazar, University of California Irvine; Lauren N. Whitehurst, University of California San Francisco; Sara C. Mednick, University of California Irvine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Sleep benefits learning, including long-term memory (LTM) and working memory (WM). However, it’s unclear whether sleep features of central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) causally interplay in supporting different types of sleep-dependent cognitive enhancement. Here, we used Zolpidem to manipulate spindles (measured by sigma power) and vagal activity (measured by high-frequency HRV; HF) and investigated the trade-off between improvement in LTM and WM performance. We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subjects design (N=38; Mage = 20.85 ± 2.97 years, 19 Females) to test if Zolpidem increases performance on a word paired-associates task by boosting spindles, while decrease performance on the operation-span WM task by suppressing vagal tone, during the night of sleep. We explored the impact of Zolpidem on ANS profiles during sleep and showed that Zolpidem increased heart rate and decreased vagal activity during sleep, suggesting a vagolytic effect. Also, Zolpidem increased LTM retention but decreased overnight WM improvement, compared to Placebo. We found a positive correlation between WM improvement and vagal activity, while a negative correlation between LTM retention and vagal activity, suggested a functional role of vagal activity on WM and LTM. Using effective connectivity, we showed that Zolpidem increased the causal effect of sigma on HF. Such causal information flow was correlated with the difference between overnight LTM and WM changes: the more sigma’s causal effect over HF, the more hippocampal-dependent sleep benefits (LTM) than the prefrontal-dependent task (WM). These findings suggested a causal role of vagal activity on sleep-dependent cognition, and an antagonist role of spindles and vagal activity, which implicates a trade-off between LTM and WM processing during sleep.</p>
