        <h1>A novel, high-throughput monitoring system for maternal behavior in mice</h1><h2>Luisa Schuster</h2><h3>Robert Froemke, PhD, New York University/Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine/Neuroscience Institute; Adam Mar, PhD, New York University/Neuroscience Institute</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Understanding the neural circuitry of maternal behavior requires a comprehensive<br/>functional analysis of the repertoire an animal has developed in an ecologically valid setting to ensure its survival. To achieve this, we designed an ethological automated habitat for mice, where behavioral data can be collected for months at a time and that supports gain/loss-of- function interventions and neural recordings. Our naturalistic enclosure is soundproofed and temperature and humidity-controlled to simulate the conditions of a mouse burrow in the wild.<br/><br/>Previously, our lab found that the neuropeptide oxytocin could promote long-term plasticity and mediate experience-dependent changes in neural circuits that serve to increase the sensitivity to pup cues, thereby facilitating behavioral responses to pup distress. These behavioral responses to pup social signals continues throughout life, possibly benefitting future offspring. Central and peripheral release of oxytocin during pregnancy and perinatally has been shown to support the onset of maternal behavior and facilitate attachment, bonding, and breastfeeding, both by increasing the salience of social cues and by interacting with reward systems that reinforce mother-infant interactions<br/><br/>As proof of concept, we used this comprehensive behavioral phenotyping tool to investigate mother-pup interactions in the nest across consecutive litters. To elucidate the effects of oxytocinergic variability in maternal bonding, we monitored four wild-type female mice across pregnancies (two of them from mating to their third pregnancy), as well as two oxytocin receptor knockout females over mating and first pregnancy. We found that primiparous dams spend less time in the nest as these same animals then do in later pregnancies. We also found that perinatal nest quality is a robust predictor of the survival of the litter; the lower the nest integrity, the higher the likelihood the litter wonâ€™t survive. Interestingly, wild-type dams who neglect or cannibalize their pups show similar nest-building patterns and time spent in the nest as oxytocin receptor knockout mice who tend to have notoriously high pup mortality.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
