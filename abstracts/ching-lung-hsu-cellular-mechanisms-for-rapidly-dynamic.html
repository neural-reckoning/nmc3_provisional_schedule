        <h1>Cellular mechanisms for rapidly dynamic neural code in spatial navigation</h1><h2>Ching-Lung Hsu</h2><h3>Xinyu Zhao, Janelia Research Campus; Aaron Milstein, Neurosurgery Department, Stanford University School of Medicine; Nelson Spruston, Janelia Research Campus</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Navigation usually involves complex tasks that require neural representation of environments, with the flexibility to respond to rapidly dynamic behavioral or cognitive variables. For instance, in the hippocampus, a brain area important for navigation, relatively small changes in cues can quickly modulate the neural representation of space. Besides, animals also learn to form such neural maps incorporated with task-relevant information. Remarkably, these processes can happen as promptly as in no more than a few seconds.

Dynamic hippocampal coding likely supports a hallmark complexity of spatial cognition, but the cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this talk, I will discuss our recent findings that the rapid and flexible formation and adaptation of place-dependent neural firing could be mediated by nonlinear subcellular integration or via synaptic plasticity, through experiments applying whole-cell patch-clamp recording to CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices and in awake, behaving mice, as well as computational modeling. These results suggest a cellular and biophysical basis for neural computations fundamental to flexible and adaptive behavior.
