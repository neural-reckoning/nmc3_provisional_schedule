        <h1>Evidence of Social Buffering in Rats Housed in Individually Ventilated Cages (IVCs)</h1><h2>Benjamin Streatch (he/him)</h2><h3>Benjamin Streatch; Samantha Irwin; Emma Littler; Janet Menard, Queen's University Department of Psychology</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Rodent research facilities are increasingly adopting the use of individually ventilated cages (IVCs), despite initial evidence that these hermetically sealed housing units might be inherently stressful. As well, maintaining IVCs under positive air pressure could be more stressful than negative air pressure, in that the former (but not the latter) completely isolates rodents from the smells and sounds of other conspecifics in the colony. We asked if social housing, known to buffer rats’ responses to acute and/or chronic stress, serves a similar, protective role when rodents are housed in IVCs, and further, whether “social buffering” depends on the type of air pressure adopted. Rats were randomly assigned to either single- or paired-housing in each of the two air pressure conditions. After eight weeks in their respective housing condition, rats were tested in the shock-probe burying test, and then their brain tissue was processed to determine oxytocin-immunoreactivity (OT-ir) in the hypothalamus. Independent of air pressure, single-housed rats displayed marked reductions in probe burying relative to pair-housed rats. Given that chronic stress reduces active coping responses, including shock-probe burying, it might be the case that chronic stress-related outcomes linked to IVCs can be buffered by social housing. Our OT findings partially support this, in that the number of OT-ir cells was reduced in the posterior parvocellular region of the PVN of single-housed rats, but only if they were housed under negative air pressure. This suggests that these effects of air pressure condition were buffered by social housing. These findings inform efforts to improve housing conditions for animals used in research.<br/><br/>Acknowledgements: Research Supported by NSERC<br/><br/></p>
