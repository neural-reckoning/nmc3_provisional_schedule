        <h1>Distinct higher-order representations of natural sounds in human and ferret auditory cortex</h1><h2>Agnès  Landemard</h2><h3>Célian Bimbard, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology ;  Charlie Demené, Physics For Medecine; Shihab Shamma, Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs; Sam Norman-Haigneré, Zuckerman Institute for Mind Brain Behavior ; Yves Boubenec, Laboratoire des Systèmes Perceptifs</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Little is known about how neural representations of natural sounds differ across species. For example, speech and music play a unique role in human hearing, yet it is unclear how their cortical representations differ between humans and other animals. In a previous study, we found that humans showed selectivity for natural vs. spectrotemporally-matched synthetic speech and music in non-primary regions, that both cannot be explained by lower-level modulation statistics, and do not yet reflect explicit semantic knowledge. Here, we addressed the question of whether such higher-order selectivity is present in other species. Precisely, we measured cortical responses in ferrets to the same set of natural and synthetic sounds previously tested in humans, as well as natural and synthetic ferret vocalizations, using functional Ultrasound imaging, a newly developed wide-field imaging technique. We found that tuning for spectrotemporal modulations present in both natural and synthetic sounds was similar between humans and ferrets, and could be quantitatively predicted across species, consistent with prior findings. But unlike humans, ferret responses to natural and synthetic sounds were similar throughout primary and non-primary auditory cortex even when comparing natural and synthetic ferret vocalizations; and the small differences that were present in ferrets were weak and spatially scattered. This finding reveals that auditory representations in humans and ferrets diverge sharply at late stages of cortical processing, potentially driven by higher-order processing demands in speech and music.</p>
