        <h1>Glutamate-to-GABA neurotransmitter switching induced by drugs of abuse and its impact on behavior</h1><h2>Marta Pratelli</h2><h3>Nicholas C. Spitzer </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse induces plastic changes in the brain that contribute to the appearance of drug-induced behavioral alterations. However, the relevance of some of these plastic changes and the extent of their behavioral impact have not yet been elucidated. An environmentally-induced form of neuroplasticity only beginning to be investigated in the context of drugs of abuse is neurotransmitter switching, which occurs when neurons lose expression of one transmitter and gain expression of another one, often switching the sign of the synapse and causing changes in behavior. <br/>To determine whether exposure to drugs causes neurotransmitter switching, we chronically exposed mice to either phencyclidine (PCP) or methamphetamine. These two drugs have different targets and mechanisms of action in the brain, but produce similar behavioral alterations such as cognitive deficits, hyperlocomotion and locomotor sensitization. <br/>We find that repeated administration of either PCP or methamphetamine induces a subset of excitatory glutamatergic neurons in the prelimbic cortex of adult mice to gain an inhibitory GABAergic phenotype, while losing the expression of the glutamatergic marker vesicular glutamate transporter 1. These changes occur in the same neurons as shown using transgenic mice in which glutamatergic neurons are permanently labelled by mCherry. To test the link between this neurotransmitter switch and drug-induced behavioral alterations we prevented the ability of glutamatergic neurons to gain GABA by injecting a Cre-dependent AAV expressing GAD1shRNA in the prelimbic cortex of vGluT1::Cre +/- mice prior to exposure to PCP. This treatment rescues PCP-induced cognitive deficits and locomotor sensitization, establishing a cause-and-effect relationship between the PCP-induced glutamate-to-GABA neurotransmitter switch and the behavioral alterations we have examined. <br/>We are now investigating the role of brain activity in mediating this neurotransmitter switching, as well as analyzing the downstream targets of switching neurons and other switching events at the whole brain level using Clarity.<br/></p>
