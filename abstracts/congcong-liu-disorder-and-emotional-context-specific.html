        <h1>Disorder- and emotional context-specific neurofunctional alterations during inhibitory  control in generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder</h1><h2>Congcong Liu</h2><h3>Congcong Liu, Xiaolei Xu, Yuanshu Chen, Fei Xin, Benjamin Becker, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) are highly debilitating and co-morbid disorders. Previous case control studies in either MDD or GAD patients suggest shared emotional and cognitive dysregulations, particularly exaggerated attention to negative information, yet partly separable alterations in cognitive control. However, common and disorder-specific alterations in the interaction between emotion and inhibitory control are poorly understood. 
Method: In order to determine disorder-specific behavioral and neurofunctional alterations in this domain the present study examined emotional context-specific inhibitory control in unmedicated, treatment-na√Øve, first episode MDD (n = 37) and GAD (n = 35) patients and healthy controls (n = 35) by employing a validated affective go/no-go fMRI paradigm. 
Result: On the behavioral level, we found evidence for supporting the disorder-specific alterations, such that MDD but not GAD patients exhibited impaired inhibitory control irrespective of emotional context (indexed through accuracy rates of no-go trials). On the neural level specifically MDD patients demonstrated attenuated recruitment of a broad bilateral network encompassing inferior/medial parietal and posterior frontal as well as mid-cingulate regions during cognitive control in the negative context (pFWE<.05, whole-brain). Further examination of disorder-specific alterations and potential compensatory recruitment on the neural level revealed that GAD patients exhibited a stronger engagement of the left DLPFC relative to MDD patients and that within the group of GAD patients better cognitive control in negative contexts associated with higher recruitment of this region (pFWE<.05, whole-brain), possibly reflecting a compensatory mechanism on the neural level that facilitates intact performance in GAD. 
Conclusion: Findings from the present study suggest disorder- and emotional context-specific behavioral and neurofunctional deficits in inhibitory control in MDD in negative emotional contexts and may point to a depression-specific neuropathological mechanism. In contrast, GAD patients may maintain intact performance via compensatory recruitment of prefrontal regulatory regions.
