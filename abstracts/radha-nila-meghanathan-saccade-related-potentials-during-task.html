        <h1>Saccade-related potentials during task-related refixation behaviour</h1><h2>Radha Nila Meghanathan</h2><h3>Cees van Leeuwen, Laboratory for Perceptual Dynamics, Brain & Cognition Research Unit, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium & Center for Cognitive Science, University of Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany; Marcello Giannini, Laboratory for Perceptual Dynamics, Brain & Cognition Research Unit, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Andrey R. Nikolaev, Department of Psychology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden & Laboratory for Perceptual Dynamics, Brain & Cognition Research Unit, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>When a saccade is planned, attention shifts to the subsequent fixation location before the saccade is executed. In a free viewing task, this attention shift is biased by higher-order processes related to the task. We used EEG to study the dependence of pre-saccadic attention shifts on task-related processes. The EEG activity in the interval preceding a saccade is known as the saccade-related potential (SRP). We studied SRPs in a visual search task requiring memorization of multiple targets for subsequent change detection. Such a complex task naturally leads to refixations, i.e. the eyes returning to previously visited locations, depending on the task-relevance of the fixated item. We compared SRPs between first fixations and refixations for task-relevant (target) and task-irrelevant (distractor) items. Both task-relevance and type of fixation (first fixation vs refixation) affect working memory load, which biases pre-saccadic attention. Fixations on targets load working memory with both identity and location information, whereas fixations on distractors load working memory only with identity information. Higher working memory load is also observed in our task during first fixations, which are made for memorization of a new target in comparison to refixations, which are made for rehearsal of previously fixated items. First fixations had longer durations than refixations indicating a difference in pre-saccadic attention. Consistent with this finding, we observed an effect of both task-relevance and fixation type on the SRP in the interval preceding the saccade away from a target but we found no such effect for distractors. Higher SRP amplitudes were seen in the occipital region for first fixations than refixations with the opposite effect in the frontal region. Our results provide neurophysiological evidence for the effect of task-relevance and working memory load refixation on saccade planning. </p>
