        <h1>Development of the Functional Assessment of Motor and Process Skills Scale among clients with Acquired Brain Injury </h1><h2>Stuti  Chakraborty </h2><h3>Reetha Janet Sureka; Abraham Peter J.; Samuel Kamalesh Kumar S.; Dr. Judy Ann John </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>BACKGROUND:. Occupational Therapy intervention aims to improve the client’s occupational performance, hence there is a need for occupational therapists to assess the client’s deficits in areas such as cognitive, motor or psychosocial ability. Current tools available for assessing such deficits are not performance based or specific to skills required for occupational performance. <br/>AIM: To develop and validate a function-based assessment tool – the Functional Assessment of Motor and Process Skills Scale (FUMPS) in order to determine the specific deficits in motor and processing skills required for occupational performance, among clients with Acquired Brain Injury. <br/>METHODS: The study consisted of 2 phases. The first phase involved tool development and obtaining expert panel’s opinion. The second phase consisted of standardization of the tool. For standardization, the tool was administered on 25 participants with acquired brain injury by two different raters and at two different points of time for finding the inter rater and test retest reliability. For finding concurrent validity, the tool was compared with COVS and MOCA scores of the participants.<br/>RESULTS: FUMPS was found to have good correlation for inter rater reliability for both the motor and process skill components (motor skill - Cronbach’s alpha 0.98 , process skill – Cronbach’s alpha = 0.99) between two raters and was also statistically significant (P = 0.0 for both motor and process skill). It was also found to have good correlation for test retest reliability (motor skill – Cronbach’s alpha = 0.99, process skill – Cronbach’s alpha = 0.97) and was also statistically significant (P = 0.00 for both motor and process skill). While assessing concurrent validity, the tool was found to have good correlation with MOCA (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.83), moderate correlation with COVS (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.78) and was statistically significant (P = 0.00 for both). <br/>CONCLUSION: From this study it can be concluded that the FUMPS is a reliable and valid measure for finding the specific motor and process skill deficits while performing functional tasks among persons with acquired brain injury. <br/></p>
