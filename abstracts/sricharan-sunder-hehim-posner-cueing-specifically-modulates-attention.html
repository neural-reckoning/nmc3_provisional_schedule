        <h1>Posner cueing specifically modulates attention, but not expectation: Behavioral and neural evidence</h1><h2>Sricharan Sunder (he/him)</h2><h3>Kavya Rajendran, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore; Devarajan Sridharan, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Attention and expectation are cognitive processes that help us navigate our environment efficiently. Each can modulate observers’ perceptual sensitivity (d’), decisional criteria (c), or both. Standard “attention” tasks involving probabilistic attention cues (e.g Posner cueing task), are hypothesized to conflate the effects of these two processes on behavior. <br/><br/>We tested this hypothesis by having the same set of n=19 subjects perform two tasks: a standard Posner cueing task (two-alternative detection/2-ADC task) and a two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) task. We replicated a previous study (Wyart et al, PNAS, 2012, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1120118109) in which subjects performed an detection 2-AFC task with independent probability (expectation) and relevance (attention) cues. Our task overcame key limitations of this previous study, and confirmed that signal probability modulated criteria alone whereas relevance modulated d’ alone. <br/><br/>Next, the same subjects who performed the 2-AFC task also performed a 2-ADC (Posner cueing) task with spatial probabilistic cues. Subjects were cued to the most probable location of an upcoming target event (change in orientation) and indicated whether they perceived the change at the cued location, at the uncued location, or not at all. In this task, probabilistic cueing modulated both d’ and criteria. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, only d’ modulations (difference in d’ between cued and uncued locations) were correlated across subjects between the 2-ADC and 2-AFC tasks (r=0.63, p<0.01, n=19 subjects) whereas criterion modulations were uncorrelated (r=-0.13, p=0.56). In addition, relevance cues (but not probability cues) in the 2-AFC task, and Posner cues in the 2-ADC task systematically modulated the power of EEG steady state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and alpha-band oscillations. <br/><br/>Our results provide direct behavioral and neural evidence indicating that probabilistic cues, such as Posner cues, serve as attention, rather than expectation, cues.</p>
