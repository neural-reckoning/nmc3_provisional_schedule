        <h1>Distinct synaptic plasticity timescales enable engram (de-)maturation in systems consolidation</h1><h2>Douglas Feitosa Tom√©</h2><h3>Sadra Sadeh, Imperial College London; Claudia Clopath, Imperial College London</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In a contextual fear conditioning experiment, prefrontal cortex engram cells are formed in a silent state but undergo a process of maturation as a result of systems consolidation. In contrast, hippocampal engram cells are initially generated in a mature state and later withstand de-maturation. It has been proposed that these engram dynamics are not restricted to fear memories but instead are characteristic of episodic memory engrams. However, the exact mechanisms underlying engram (de-)maturation have not been investigated yet. Here, we present a spiking network model of systems consolidation that exhibits both maturation of cortical and de-maturation of hippocampal engram cells. Our model contains individual subnetworks for the thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus with excitatory and inhibitory synapses within and between these regions being subject to plasticity mechanisms at different rates. In this model, cortical engram cells are initially silent in recent recall but mature and become active in remote recall after a consolidation period. Inversely, hippocampal engrams are active in recent but not in remote recall and, hence, de-mature. Hippocampal engram cells as well as spontaneous synchronized reactivations in the three brain regions in our model were crucial for systems consolidation of memories. Importantly, the above engram dynamics and interdependencies displayed by our model are aligned with previous experimental findings. Our model also makes the following experimentally testable predictions: engram cells in mediodorsal thalamus (MD) are active in recent and remote recall and are essential for the maturation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) engram cells, PFC inhibitory engram cells become selective to stimuli with systems consolidation, and the coupling between MD and PFC prior to consolidation is predictive of the retrograde amnesia curve induced by hippocampal damage. Overall, our modelling results suggest that a variety of synaptic plasticity mechanisms operating over distinct timescales across brain regions is coordinated to promote systems consolidation.</p>
