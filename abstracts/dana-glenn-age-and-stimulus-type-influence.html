However, few studies have examined threat generalization across development and no developmental studies have compared generalization gradients for social vs nonsocial threat. We used representational similarity analysis and fMRI to assess developmental differences in the association between neural threat representations and explicit memory across social and non-social stimuli.
Twenty adults (Mage = 25.8) and 16 youth (Mage = 14.1) completed one social and one nonsocial threat conditioning and extinction-recall paradigm. During conditioning, the social paradigm paired a woman’s face with a scream and the nonsocial paradigm paired a colored bell with an aversive alarm. Three weeks later, during extinction recall, participants viewed the threat cue (CS+), safety cue (CS-), and generalization stimuli consisting of CS-/CS+ blends. Multi-voxel BOLD patterns were measured in five ROIs (vmPFC, dmPFC, anterior insula, dACC, amygdala) and representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) were created for each subject in each ROI and condition. Individuals’ RDMs were correlated with memory ratings matrices, averaged within each age group and paradigm.
A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed a Task x ROI x Age interaction, F(4,136) = 4.47, p = .002. Follow-up t-tests found a higher correlation between both youth and adults’ anterior insular activity patterns and memory ratings in the social than nonsocial task (ps < .002). Additionally, adults’ neural activity was more correlated with memory ratings for the social than nonsocial task in the dmPFC and vmPFC (ps < .004). Finally, youth’s dACC activity was more correlated with memory ratings for the social than nonsocial task, t(15) = 3.61, p = .003. 
These findings indicate that salience of social threats may contribute to greater correspondence between neural activity and memory ratings across age groups. Further, whereas adults may rely on PFC to make categorical distinctions between threat and safety, adolescents may engage salience network structures.</p>
