Using perceptual decision-making as a model system, previous work has focused on situations in which participants are observers adapting their decisions to incoming evidence. However, in many real-life settings, subjects exert active control over their environment when sampling information for decision-making. Here, we examined how being in control over evidence sampling influenced changes of mind and the associated confidence, as compared to uncontrollable environments. Across five variants of the same experiment (N=113 human participants), we found that changes of mind required more evidence against current beliefs in controllable environments. These changes of mind were also associated with reduced confidence, but were more likely to be confirmed on the next trial. Computational modelling revealed that in controllable environments, more stable beliefs, rather than a reduced sensitivity to evidence explained these differences. At the neurophysiological level, changes of mind in controllable environments were associated with a stronger involvement of a dorsal attentional network in MEG, and were followed by an increased pupil-linked arousal during decision evaluation. Together these findings characterise specific signatures of human information seeking in controllable environments.</p>
