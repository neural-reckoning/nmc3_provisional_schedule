        <h1>Mental compression of spatial sequences  in human working memory  using numerical and geometrical primitives</h1><h2>Fosca Al Roumi</h2><h3>SÃ©bastien Marti, Liping Wang, Marie Amalric, Stanislas Dehaene</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>How does the human brain store sequences of spatial locations? The standard view is that each consecutive item occupies a distinct slot in working memory. Instead, we formulate and test the alternative hypothesis that the human brain compresses the whole sequence using an abstract, language-like code that captures the numerical and geometrical regularities of the sequence at multiple nested levels. We exposed participants to spatial sequences of fixed length but variable regularity, and asked them to remember the sequence in order to detect deviants, while their brain activity was recorded using magneto-encephalography. Using multivariate decoders, each successive location could be decoded from brain signals, and upcoming locations could be decoded prior to their actual onset. Crucially, sequences with lower complexity, defined as the minimal description length provided by the formal language, and whose memory representation was therefore predicted to be more compressed, led to lower error rates and to increased anticipations. Furthermore, neural codes specific to the numerical and geometrical primitives of the postulated language could be detected, both in isolation and within the sequences. These results suggest that the human brain detects sequence regularities at multiple nested levels and uses them to compress long sequences in working memory.</p>
