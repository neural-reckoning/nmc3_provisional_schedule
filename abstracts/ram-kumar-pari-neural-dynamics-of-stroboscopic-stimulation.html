        <h1>Neural dynamics of stroboscopic stimulation at different stimulation frequencies</h1><h2>Ram Kumar Pari</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Stroboscopic stimulation has been previously shown to induce visual hallucinations and altered states of consciousness, state by entraining the brain to the driving frequency, similar to those reported under psychedelics; Although little systematic research exists on the effect of specific stimulation frequency on the experience. Previous studies have used different measures associated with consciousness, with psychedelics to quantify and measure such altered states of consciousness (ASC) produced and its effect on consciousness. The present study investigated the effects of different stroboscopic stimulation frequencies (3, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 19 Hz) on neural dynamics, using measures such as signal diversity (Lempel-Ziv complexity) and spectral power measured using EEG and attempted to relate these changes to self-reported changes in experiential content. The results indicated the stimulation frequencies within and near the alpha band (8 â€“ 12 Hz) caused the greatest increase across all tested neural measures, with 8 Hz consistently displaying the most pronounced results, relative to baseline. All tested frequencies led to an increase in all experiential dimensions, relative to baseline and produced subjective visual and experiential effects similar to those associated with psychedelics.  The results highlight the rich potential of using stroboscopic stimulation as a means of non-invasive neuromodulation.
