        <h1>Systematic analysis of goal-related movements in alloparental mice during pup retrieval behavior </h1><h2>Keerthi Krishnan (She, Her)</h2><h3>Parker Stevenson; Devin Casenhiser</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Parenting is an ethologically relevant social behavior consisting of stereotypic behavioral components involving the care and nourishment of young. First-time rodent dams seek and gather wandering/scattered pups back to the nest (pup retrieval), an essential aspect of maternal care. Over the decades, qualitative observations of the behaving animal have been presented in quantitative discrete units. However, systematic analysis of the sequence of goal-related movements that comprise the entire behavior and which would be ultimately essential for understanding the contribution of specific neural circuits and brain regions, is usually not analyzed. Here, we present results from pup retrieval behaviors of alloparental female mice (Surrogates or Sur) of two genotypes; Mecp2-heterozygotes (Het), a female mouse model for a neuropsychiatric disorder called Rett Syndrome and their wild type (WT) siblings. Frame-by-frame analysis over different phases (habituation, isolation and retrieval) was performed manually using DataVyu software. 
We previously showed that SurHet are inefficient at pup retrieval. Here, the sequence of pup retrieval crystallizes over time for SurWT, while it does not for SurHet. Day-by-day analysis shows dynamic changes in goal-related movements in individual animals in response to the same pup stimuli. SurHet behavior in different phases are similar to SurWT, suggesting that atypical dynamic patterns in SurHet behavior is dependent on context. Tactile sensory perception between adult and pups has been previously shown to be important for maternal behavior, by studies in the 1980s. Based on our results, we suggest that tactile stimulation of whiskers/face and somatosensation of the SurWT body may play essential roles in efficient pup retrieval, which might be adversely affected in SurHet. These results suggest atypical sensory processing in this female mouse model for Rett Syndrome.
