        <h1>The color of the flash attenuates its mislocalization in the flash-jump illusion</h1><h2>Harpreet  Saini (she/her)</h2><h3>Heather Jordan, York University; Mazyar Fallah, York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the modulatory role of task-irrelevant color on higher-level cognitive tasks involving response inhibition. In this study, we investigated whether color also affects visual perception earlier in the visual processing hierarchy, using the flash-jump illusion. In this illusion when an apparent motion stimulus, i.e. a rectangular bar appearing at different locations along a trajectory, changes color at a single position, observers perceive this color change as occurring farther along the trajectory of motion. This mislocalization error has been shown to be dependent on responses in area V4, an intermediate stage in the ventral visual stream. Our results demonstrated that the color of the flash modulated the magnitude of the flash-jump effect such that participants reported less of a shift, i.e. a more veridical flash location, for both red and blue flashes, as compared to green and yellow. This pattern of color effects was present for both accuracy and precision in localizing the flash. Given that neural correlates of the flash jump effect are found in area V4, our findings suggest that color-dependent modulations of perceptual processes can occur as early as the intermediate stages of visual processing. Since the color of the flash affected its localization, these color modulations must be inherent and automatic in visual processing.</p>
