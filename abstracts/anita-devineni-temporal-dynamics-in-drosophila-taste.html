        <h1>Temporal dynamics in Drosophila taste coding influence synaptic plasticity</h1><h2>Anita Devineni</h2><h3>Julia U. Deere, Columbia University; Bei Sun, Columbia University; Richard Axel, Columbia University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The taste system ensures that animals consume nutritious foods and avoid ingesting toxins. Taste also modulates responses to other stimuli; for example, animals learn to avoid cues that are associated with bitter taste. The timing of neural activity is a key feature of neural encoding in many systems, but few studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of taste responses. Using calcium imaging, we found that Drosophila taste sensory neurons show striking differences in their response dynamics. Most classes of taste neurons show a sustained response throughout the stimulus presentation that rapidly diminishes upon stimulus removal. However, some bitter-sensing neurons show strong, transient responses at both the onset and offset of the stimulus. Moreover, with repeated bitter stimulation the onset response rapidly habituates while the offset response remains strong.<br/><br/>We observed the same bitter response dynamics in a set of downstream neurons, the PPL1 dopaminergic neurons (DANs). PPL1 DANs innervate the mushroom body, the learning and memory center of the fly brain, and mediate aversive olfactory learning. Studies have shown that PPL1 DANs are activated by aversive stimuli and drive learning by inducing synaptic depression at synapses onto mushroom body output neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that repeatedly pairing odor with bitter taste induced synaptic potentiation, not depression, at these synapses. However, synaptic depression could be induced by pairing odor with bitter removal. By combining calcium imaging with optogenetic stimulation to mimic PPL1 DAN activity, we found that these unexpected plasticity effects could be explained by the combination of two factors: 1) intrinsic timing rules that govern mushroom body plasticity, and 2) the dominance of the bitter offset response during repeated bitter exposure. These results demonstrate the importance of taste response dynamics and reveal unexpected complexity in how dopaminergic modulation drives plasticity in the primary learning center of the fly.</p>
