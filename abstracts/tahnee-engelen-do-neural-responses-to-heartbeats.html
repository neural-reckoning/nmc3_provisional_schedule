        <h1>Do neural responses to heartbeats distinguish self and other in an emotional perspective taking task?</h1><h2>Tahnée Engelen</h2><h3>Anne Buot, École Normale Supérieure; Julie Grèzes, École Normale Supérieure; Catherine Tallon-Baudry, École Normale Supérieure;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>On a daily basis, we share in each other's joy and frustrations, yet despite the contagious nature of emotions, we are perfectly capable of dissociating our own emotional state to that of someone else. Such a differentiation between self and other might seem trivial, but becomes more puzzling considering that many physiological responses and neural activations are shared between experiencing and observing of emotions. One proposed mechanism in which our sense of self might be anchored is the neural monitoring of heartbeats. The debate on how our emotional experiences are shaped by bodily signals, in particular cardiac signals, is long-standing, yet  this relationship has been mostly explored in how emotions might change cardiac activity. Here, we propose a new avenue of research; how is the neural monitoring of heartbeats related to our emotional experience, and more specifically, does the neural monitoring of heartbeats help differentiate self from other in emotion? To explore this question, participants engaged in an emotional perspective taking task while their brain activity was measured using EEG, and several peripheral physiological measures were recorded (cardiac activity, facial EMG, and Skin Conductance Responses (SCR)). While participants prepared to rate a naturalistic image for either their own emotion or the emotion depicted in the image, Heartbeat Evoked Responses (HER) significantly differed between the self and other condition. Additionally, during exploration of the image, a self-other difference in SCR was found, as well as an interaction for the valence of the image and self-other condition in the facial zygomatic muscle. Observed self-other HER differences were localized to frontal and occipital sources, which correlated with subjective ratings of the images, as well as empathic traits, but not with the effects observed in physiological responses. Our results show that the HER can perform a role in self-other distinction in emotional contexts.</p>
