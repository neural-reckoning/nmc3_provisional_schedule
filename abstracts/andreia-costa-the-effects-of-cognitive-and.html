        <h1>The effects of cognitive and mechanical restrictions on modular neuromuscular control in younger and older adults during beam walking</h1><h2>Andréia Costa</h2><h3>Andrew Sawers, Department of Kinesiology, College of Applied Health Sciences, The University of Illinois at Chicago, USA; Tibor Hortobágyi, Center for Human Movement Sciences, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands; Renato Moraes, School of Physical Education and Sport of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, Brazil</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The manipulation of cognitive and mechanical restrictions affects performance and spatiotemporal parameters of gait. However, it is unclear if such restrictions also influence neuromuscular control of gait or whether age mediates their effect. Hence, we examined the effects of cognitive task and changes in arms position during beam walking in younger and older adults. Younger (YA, 23.8±3.2y, n=17) and older adults (OA, 69±3.9y, n=14) walked along a 6-cm wide beam (2-cm high, 4-m long), with free and chest folded arms, with and without a cognitive task (serial subtraction by 3). We used non-negative matrix factorization to extract muscle synergies from surface EMG recordings of 13 leg and trunk muscles. Differences in modular control complexity were assessed by comparing the number of muscle synergies (nsyn) and the variability accounted for by a single muscle synergy (VAF-1). The number of significantly active muscles per synergy (Wmus) and the sum of significantly active muscles per synergy (Wsum) were also compared to assess muscle coactivity and modular control efficiency. Addition of the cognitive task increased Wmus (without: 3.9±1.2, with: 4.4±1.3, p=0.047), only in YA, indicating increased coactivity in the presence of the subtractions in this group. On the other hand, restricting arm motion increased VAF-1 (folded: 74.5±3.7%, free: 73.2±4.2%, p=0.018), just in OA, suggesting less complexity of modular control with arms folded within older adults. Age was responsible for differences in nsyn (YA:7.0±1.3, OA:6.1±1.2, p=0.038), VAF-1 (YA:68.9±5.6%, OA:73.9±4.0%, p=0.004) and Wsum (YA: 2.1±0.5, OA: 2.5±0.7, p=0.034), implying less complexity and efficiency in modular control in OA. In conclusion, cognitive and mechanical restrictions affected neuromuscular control differently based on age, changing coactivity and complexity in YA and OA respectively. Older adults still exhibited a modular control strategy that was less complex and efficient than younger adults. FUNDING: FAPESP/Brazil (Grants 2018/18081-0 and 2019/00387-9).</p>
