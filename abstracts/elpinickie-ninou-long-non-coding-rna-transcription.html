        <h1>Long non-coding RNA – Transcription factor regulatory networks in mammalian neural stem cells</h1><h2>Elpinickie Ninou</h2><h3>Artemis Michail, Panagiotis Politis</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>With the advent of new generation technologies, a growing list of formerly unknown regulatory RNA species have come into spotlight. Among them, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been found to control stem cell pluripotency, carcinogenesis, development and function of several tissues and organs. Although thousands of lncRNAs are expressed in adult mammalian brain in a highly patterned and specific manner, they remain poorly characterized and their roles in brain development have not yet been studied.
To tackle this question, we initially performed RNA-Seq analysis in the developing nervous system of mouse embryo. Based on this analysis, we identified many lncRNAs highly expressed in neural cells. We focused on lncRNAs, which are transcribed from genomic loci in close proximity with protein coding genes, encoding for critical transcription factors (TFs) in brain development. We hypothesized that these lncRNAs may be implicated in the regulation of neighboring TF genes.
To this end, we characterized the changes in the expression profiles of a number of lncRNAs-TF pairs during development of mouse brain. In this study, we further focused on the functional role of lncRNA TCONS_00034309 in the differentiation of neural stem cells and its relation to Tbr2 transcription factor by in vitro and in vivo overexpression and knock-down studies, using CRISPR-dCas9-KRAB Effector System.
To conclude, our data suggest critical roles for this lncRNA in neuronal differentiation and astrogliogenesis during brain development. Our study provides insights into the involvement of lncRNAs in organogenesis and shows how lncRNAs and protein-coding genes form regulatory networks with important functions in neural stem cells.
