        <h1>Maintenance of refined visual receptive fields through BDNF-TrkB signaling depends on presynaptic GABA levels, not postsynaptic GABAA receptors or the scaffolding proteins gephyrin and PSD-95.</h1><h2>Parag Juvale</h2><h3>David B. Mudd, Neuroscience Institute, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA USA;  Nitheyaa Shree, Neuroscience Institute, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA USA;  Sarah L. Pallas, Molecular and Cellular Biology Graduate Program, University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA USA, Neuroscience Institute, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA USA.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The development of visual response properties is thought to require early sensory experience, but our previous work showed that visual experience is not necessary, and spontaneous activity is sufficient for visual receptive fields (RFs) in superior colliculus (SC) or visual cortex (V1) to refine. Instead, juvenile visual experience is necessary only to maintain RF size in adulthood via a BDNF-TrkB dependent mechanism that preserves lateral inhibition. RF expansion significantly hampers visual processing ability of dark reared (DR) hamsters, and treatment with a TrkB agonist during a critical period rescues it. In this study, we investigated whether postsynaptic changes could underlie RF expansion in SC and V1 of DR adults. Dark rearing could interfere with the maturation of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subunit composition, resulting in a higher α2/α1 (immature/mature) subunit ratio, compared to light reared hamsters. The α5/α1 (extrasynaptic/synaptic) GABAAR subunit ratio in DR adults might be higher than normal, resulting in lower phasic inhibition. Alternatively, dark rearing could reduce gephyrin localization at the synapse, reducing the stability of the synaptic GABAA receptors and consequently, the overall inhibitory effect of GABA. Lastly, dark rearing could also result in reduced synaptic accumulation of the scaffold protein, postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), resulting in reduced synaptic anchoring of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and AMPA receptors (AMPARs), potentially affecting long-term potentiation. Using western blotting, we found no significant differences between DR and normal animals in SC or V1 for the synaptic GABAAR subunits, or the scaffolding proteins anchoring the GABAA or glutamate receptors at the synapse. Our results rule out several alternative explanations for the loss of GABAAR function identified by our earlier work, and support reductions in presynaptic GABA rather than postsynaptic alterations as the primary explanation for the loss of RF stability in DR animals.</p>
