        <h1>The Role of Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 in Inhibitory Cortical Interneurons for Processing Ultrasonic Vocalizations</h1><h2>Deborah Rupert</h2><h3>Stephen Shea, PhD </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Rett Syndrome (RTT) are characterized by impaired communication. RTT is a pervasive, neurodevelopmental disorder previously classified as an ASD and caused by loss of function mutations in the X-linked gene methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2)- a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor critical for maintaining mature neuronal synapses.<br/><br/>Objectives: Our goal is to determine the contribution of cell-type specific Mecp2 mutation to disruptions of auditory cortical circuitry and plasticity that degrade social vocal perception in a mouse model of Rett syndrome.<br/><br/>Methods: To achieve this goal, we will use a cell-type restricted Mecp2 mutant mouse model in combination with a behavioral paradigm that relies on vocal communication. We employ pup retrieval in response to ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)- a natural, auditory-dependent, learned maternal behavior that we report to be impaired by Mecp2 mutation. USVs emitted by isolated infant pups are high-pitched distress calls that trigger a retrieval response in wild-type (WT) but not non-conditional, Mecp2 heterozygous females. Our previous work suggests that this difference is the result of impaired plasticity in the auditory cortex (ACtx) of Mecp2 mutant animals, a brain region required to detect and interpret vocalizations. ACtx inhibitory interneurons seem to be especially important for processing of socially relevant stimuli (e.g. USVs). Here we build on these findings by selectively inhibiting transcription of Mecp2 protein in specific subclasses of inhibitory interneurons (i.e. parvalbumin-, somatostatin-, and vasoactive intestinal peptide- positive populations) to determine which of these subclasses contributes most toward aberrant auditory processing in the context of our Rett mouse model.<br/><br/>Results: We examine the effects of restricted Mecp2 mutation in inhibitory interneuron subclasses on pup retrieval behavior and in vivo neural circuit activity in the ACtx in response to socially relevant auditory stimuli. We have found Mecp2 mutation restricted to the parvalbumin positive (PV+) cell type is sufficient for impairing pup retrieval behavior. Further, we have found ACtx neuronal activity in response to pup vocalizations are altered in “PV-Mecp2” mutants compared to WT controls similarly to findings from our cell-type non-specific model. These neuronal activity differences are specific to socially relevant sounds (i.e. USVs) as opposed to pure tones.<br/><br/>Conclusions: This work focuses on functional consequences of Mecp2 mutation to auditory processing circuitry that expands our understanding of the underlying etiology of RTT, identifies targets for ameliorating the downstream consequences, and informs pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders more broadly.</p>
