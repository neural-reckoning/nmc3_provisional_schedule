        <h1>A family of sensitive and specific genetically-encoded GRAB sensors for spy on neuropeptides dynamics</h1><h2>Huan Wang</h2><h3>Tongrui Qian, Peking University; Ling Wu, Peking University; Zimo ZhangRen, Peking University; Yulong Li, Peking University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neuropeptides are key signaling molecules in endocrine and nervous system, regulating virtually all physiological processes, ranging from food ingestion, sleep & circadian rhythm, to pain sensation and social behaviors. To understand their important functions in vivo, it is critical to be able to monitor neuropeptide dynamics with selectivity, sensitivity and good spatiotemporal resolution. One major hindrance to the above goal is the lack of direct, sensitive and non-invasive probes to report these bioactive peptides in vivo. Here, by tapping into GPCRs for human neuropeptides, we developed a toolbox of GRAB (GPCR activation based) sensors for neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasopressin/oxytocin, somatostatin (SST), corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), neurotensin (NT), cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), substance P and for Drosophila neuropeptides allatostatin A (AstA) and allatostatin C (AstC). These fluorescent sensors utilize native GPCR ligand binding pockets as neuropeptide sensing modules and circular-permutated GFPs as optical reporters. We have developed sensors with ultra-good selectivity for neuropeptides, with nano molecular affinity, up-to 1500% dF/F fluorescence increase upon cognate ligand application. In addition, these GRAB sensors have minimal downstream G protein coupling, or arrestin coupling, compared to their original GPCR scaffolds. We are validating these peptide sensors in slice & in vivo and extend the sensor development strategy to cover more neuropeptides in human body. The further development of these sensors and their deployment will likely significantly enhance our understanding of neuropeptide function and regulation in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.</p>
