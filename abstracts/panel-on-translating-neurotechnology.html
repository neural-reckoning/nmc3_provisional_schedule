        <h1>Panel on Translating Neurotechnology</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Nearly a decade ago, President Obama launched the US BRAIN initiative to advance technology and neuroscience research for understanding and treating disorders of the brain. Building on momentum that had been growing over the previous several decades, the BRAIN initiative cast a spotlight on the potential for neurotechnology to address some of society's greatest medical challenges, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, and many other brain diseases. The neural engineering community has responded forcefully to this call, creating several exciting new technologies that offer new important new capabilities for monitoring and regulating neural signaling throughout the nervous system. Some of these new technologies are now being transitioned into commercial products, which is a crucial step toward fulfilling the BRAIN vision. This panel includes four innovation leaders that are working to bring novel and potentially breakthrough neurotechnologies to the clinical market.

Speaker 1:  Milton Morris, President & CEO of Neuspera Medical
Talk title: Translation of a Novel Mid-Field Powering Technology for Use with an Ultraminiaturized Implantable Neuromodulation Platform

Speaker 2: Tom Oxley, CEO, Synchron
Talk title: Stentrode First in Man results
 
Speaker 3: Patrick Ganzer, Principal Research Scientist; Battelle Memorial Institute
Talk title: “Translating Neurotechnology: Brain-Computer Interfaces and Bioelectronic Medicines”

Speaker 4: Rikky Muller, Assistant Professor, University of California at Berkeley
Talk Title: Wireless and minimally invasive neurotherapeutic implants

Moderator: Dev Sarma, Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University</p>
