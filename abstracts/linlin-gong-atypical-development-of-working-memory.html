Elucidating their developmental trajectory of social information processing is important for advancing theories of etiology and intervention of ASD. While previous research has charted the development of joint attention and theory of mind, the development of perception of biological motion (BM) among children with ASD is still understudied. By viewing point-light displays of human movements, typically-developed (TD) people is capable of inferring others’ identity, gender or emotion with ease. Our recent study has found that working memory of BM (WM-BM) develops rapidly around age 4 and 5 among TD children. Here we examine whether children with ASD has similar critical development of BM. We tested WM-BM as well as that of inverted biological motion (WM-IBM) among children with and without ASD aged between 4 and 6 yrs. For TD children, both WM-BM and WM-IBM capacity increased steadily between age 4 and 6. Children with ASD had similar performance as TD children at age 4 and 5 but lagged behind at age 6. For them, only WM-IBM but not WM-BM capacity increased with age, highlighting a specific slow-down in development of social information processing. Importantly, we found that the WM-BM capacity correlated with the severity of core symptoms of autism among children with ASD, suggesting that our working memory test based on BM is a good indicator of social development in this population. Since the preference for BM stimuli is reduced among high-risk autism infants as early as 8-month old, our results suggest that early deviation in preference and perception of social stimuli would lead to impaired high-level cognition (i.e., WM here) of related stimuli years later, a developmental path that might be shared by various social-cognitive abilities among individuals with ASD.</p>
