        <h1>Reductions in Parkinson’s Disease symptoms and alpha rhythm modulations as a result of multinetwork learning to music over 3-years.</h1><h2>Karolina Bearss</h2><h3>Joseph F. X. DeSouza</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) has a fast progression of motor dysfunction within the first 5 years with annual rates of decline of 5.2 to 8.9 points on the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).  We aimed to extend research on the short-term benefits of Dance for PD and determine improvements over 3 years while participating in weekly classes. We collected EEG, mood (PANAS-X), cognitive (MMSE, PD-NMS & MDS-UPDRS Parts I, II & IV) and motor (MDS-UPDRS Part III) assessments with the goal to examine a continuous PD long-term program that can serve to compliment traditional medical treatments and examine whether disease progression is modified.  We conducted two studies: (1) examined the short-term benefits of dance (N=17) and (2) measured PD symptom progression over a 3-year period (N=32). Our results indicated that rsEEG global alpha power was highest after a single dance class in comparison to before, F(1,26) = 6.928, p < .025, η2 = .210. Individuals with PD participating in 3-yrs of dance showed no progression of motor symptoms across time (p=0.817).  Further no impairment was shown for daily living (p=0.329), motor experiences of daily living (p=0.540) and for non-motor complications (p=0.390).  To examine disease progression directly in our cohort, we matched data from Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative as our non-dance PD comparison group (PD-MJFF-Com).  A significant Group (PD-Dancers and PD-MJFF-Com) by Days interaction showed that PD who train in dance have less motor impairment (M=18.75) than PD-MJFF-Com who do not dance (M=24.61) and over time (p< 0.05). As expected, and in stark contrast to our PD-Dancers the PD-MJFF-Com showed motor impairment (UPDRS III) across time (p< 0.01). UPDRS I and II showed disease progression of PD over time (p<0.005), and (p<0.01), whereas UPDRS IV showed no progression (p= 0.365) over the same 2-year period.  Thus, multinetwork training to music is effective at slowing motor and non-motor PD symptoms.</p>
