        <h1>The structure of life sciences academia</h1><h2>Alexey Guzey</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Academia has a public image that in a lot of ways has diverges with how it actually works, both presenting a better version of itself in some aspects and a worse version in others. In my talk I will discuss the observations I made and the patterns I noticed about the way life sciences academia (with the focus on neuroscience) works after 2 years of research and conversations with more than 100 people involved with life sciences academia. Topics I will cover include the sincerity and hypocrisy of academia; the relative rigidity of academic career paths; the funding asymmetry and the power asymmetry between the young and the old researchers; cooperation and competition in academia.</p>
