        <h1>Autoantibodies in Traumatic Brain Injury : An update</h1><h2>Oumaima  Outani</h2><h3>Oumaima Outani</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most recognized subtype of injury that affects the central nervous system (CNS). TBI is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide. 
An important area of TBI research is the TBI-induced cascade of inflammatory and pathophysiological events and the resulting autoantibodies especially that literature have confirmed its role as a precursor in many neuropsychiatric disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
These autoantibodies could have a prospective role as potential biomarkers indicating the corresponding pathophysiological mechanisms following the injury.
Putative biomarkers that have been documented in experimental TBI and then in patients post-TBI
cover many processes including injury to neuronal cell bodies, demyelination, astro-glial injury, and axonal injury . Some of these identified markers include Protein (S100B), Glia Calcium-Binding, Myelin Basic Protein (MBP), and neurofilament proteins.
However, translating from experimental applicability to bedside clinical practice remains challenging. It is also essential to mention that therapeutic interventions modulatin B cells could be of therapeutic potential.
