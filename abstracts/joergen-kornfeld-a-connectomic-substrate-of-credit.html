        <h1>A connectomic substrate of credit assignment in basal ganglia reinforcement learning</h1><h2>Joergen Kornfeld</h2><h3> J Kornfeld, MIT; M Januszewski, Google Research; P Schubert, MPI of Neurobiology; V Jain, Google Research; W Denk, MPI of Neurobiology; MS Fee, MIT</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>How is experience used to improve performance? In both biological and artificial systems, the optimization of parameters that affect the system’s behavior requires a credit assignment process that determines whether a parameter affects the outcome and then allows its modification.
Here we show, by combining high-throughput volume electron microscopy with flood-filling neural networks and automated synaptic connectivity inference, that the synaptic architecture of songbird basal ganglia supports a form of local credit assessment (related to node perturbation) proposed in a model of songbird reinforcement learning. Specifically, we demonstrate that the model’s major three predictions hold true: first, cortical feedback axons that encode exploratory motor variability terminate predominantly on dendritic shafts of spiny neurons. Second, cortical axons that encode timing terminate on dendritic spines, which enable calcium-based coincidence detection and appear to be capable of creating and storing eligibility traces. Third, synapse pairs that pre-synaptically share a cortical timing axon and post-synaptically a medium spiny dendrite are substantially more similar in size than expected, indicating a history of Hebbian plasticity. Consistent with the model, we then propose a novel role for cortical feedforward inhibition (FFI) in the striatum and test its anatomical predictions by directly identifying and analyzing triplet connectivity motifs in the connectome.
Finally, we performed numerical simulations of the proposed Hebbian 3-factor learning rule (context, action feedback and reward) and show that our model can learn to imitate a simple template in a realistic number of iterations. Combined with our connectomic data, this provides strong evidence for a model of vertebrate basal ganglia reinforcement learning with a biologically plausible credit assignment mechanism.
