        <h1>Panel on Future Opportunities in Neuroscience and Neurotechnologies with BRAIN Initiative Alliance Leadership</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Join a discussion on the future of neuroscience and neurotechnology funding with leadership from federal and non-government members of the BRAIN Initiative Alliance. Listen, learn, and engage with long-time collaborators in the U.S. BRAIN Initiative as they consider questions like:

- What might we expect for neuroscience funding in the coming years? 
- What will the priorities be and will the focus of research opportunities shift? 
- What is the long-term plan for government-supported projects like data archives? 
- How might we support technology dissemination to the broader neuroscience community?

Panelists:

- Michelle Elekonich, Deputy Division Director, Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, Directorate for Biological Sciences, National Science Foundation

- David Markowitz, Program Manager, IARPA

- Caroline Montojo, Director, Life Sciences and Director, Brain Initiatives, The Kavli Foundation

- John Ngai, Director of NIH BRAIN Initiative, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

- Alyssa Picchini Schaffer, Senior Scientist & Administrative Director, Neuroscience Collaborations, The Simons Foundation</p>
