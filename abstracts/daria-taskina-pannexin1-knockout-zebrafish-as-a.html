        <h1>Pannexin1 Knockout Zebrafish as a Model for Seizure Investigation </h1><h2>Daria Taskina</h2><h3>D Taskina 1,2; PA Whyte-Fagundes 1,3; N Saffarian 1; C Zoidl 1 and GR Zoidl 1,2,3.   1.

Krembil Research Institute, Toronto</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Many epileptic patients with recurrent seizures do not respond to medical interventions available on the market today. Evidence suggests that Pannexin1, an ATP-release membrane channel, plays a vital role in modifying neuronal excitability by altering the electrical and metabolic balances of the neural network.    
Our research aims at evaluating whether Pannexin1 is a target for therapeutic intervention in epilepsy. A Pannexin1 knock-out zebrafish model was established to investigate the role of Pannexin1 in a seizure model in vivo. Additionally, we have employed probenecid, a known Pannexin1 channel blocker, to assess for the efficacy of pharmacological targeting. The resistance of the zebrafish to chemically induced seizures was investigated via their behavioural locomotor response, signs of stress on a molecular level, and in vivo electrophysiological recordings from the brain. 
Our findings demonstrate that Pannexin1 channels contribute to the distortion of the electrochemical balance and aid in the propagation of seizures in vivo. Lack of Pannexin1, or pharmacological block of the channels, resulted in decreased seizure-related behaviour and electrophysiological ictal-like events, improved survival and reduced molecular stress responses. 
Zebrafish are an appealing and multifaceted animal model for pre-clinical epilepsy studies; as they allow for high-throughput behavioural phenotyping and the examination of intact neuronal circuits. In future work we aim to incorporate Machine Learning in the analysis of zebrafish behaviour, thus automating the procedure, and unravelling novel patterns in phenotypic data.
