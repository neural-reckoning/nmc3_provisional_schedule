We present a quantitative method to analyze EEG data from patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. <br/><br/>Methods:<br/>EEG was acquired from 22 ECMO patients using a standardized stimulation paradigm that included auditory, noxious touch, and nostril stimulation. Data were divided into 111 total epochs and assessed using two metrics: spectral power and permutation entropy. We classified epochs based on increase or decrease of each metric in response to stimulation and computed scores for each epoch, both overall and for each spectral sub-band. Scores were grouped and validated against visual analysis of raw EEG. <br/><br/>Results:<br/>Variations were found to occur in all cerebral regions for both metrics. The mean overall scores for all types of stimulation for those patients identified by visual analysis as reactive were significantly higher than for those identified as unreactive: auditory (50.03 ± 46.11 vs 25.14 ± 12.27, p < 0.05), noxious touch (50.93 ±  33.32 vs 22.48 ± 11.45, p < 0.001), and nostril (48.64 ±  13.56 vs 19.61 ± 13.80, p < 0.01). Although nostril stimulation induced the largest difference on our metrics, it also resulted in the most epochs disqualified due to artifacts. <br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/>Our findings provide preliminary support for the validity of a quantitative (rather than qualitative) EEG scoring system assessing the response to stimulation using our qEEG metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply qEEG methods in the assessment of EEG reactivity in patients on ECMO support. We anticipate that further validation of this quantitative method on larger patient populations will enable new avenues of investigation and test its prognostic value.</p>
