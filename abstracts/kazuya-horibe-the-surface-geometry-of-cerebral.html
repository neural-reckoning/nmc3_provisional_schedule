        <h1>The surface geometry of cerebral cortex induces topological changes of cortical traveling waves</h1><h2>Kazuya Horibe</h2><h3>Ken-ichi Hironaka, Katsuyoshi Matsushita, Koichi Fujimoto</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>On the curved surfaces of living and nonliving materials, planar excitable wavefronts frequently exhibit a directional change and subsequently undergo a discontinuous (topological) change; i.e., a series of wavefront dynamics from collision, annihilation to splitting. Theoretical studies have shown that excitable planar stable waves change their topology significantly depending on the initial conditions on flat surfaces, whereas the directional change of the waves occurs based on the geometry of curved surfaces. However, it is not clear if the geometry of curved surfaces induces this topological change. In this study, we first demonstrated that the curved surface geometry induces bending, collision, and splitting of a planar stable wavefront by numerically solving an excitable reactionâ€“diffusion equation on a bell-shaped surface. We determined two necessary conditions for inducing the topological change: the characteristic length of the curved surface (i.e., the height of the bell-shaped structure) should be greater than the width of the wave, and the ratio of the height to the width of the bell shape should be greater than a threshold. As for the geometrical mechanism of the latter, we found that a bifurcation of the geodesics on the curved surface provides the alternative minimal paths of the wavefront, which circumvent the surface region with a high local curvature, thereby resulting in the topological change. These conditions imply that the topological change of the wavefront can be predicted on the basis of the curved surfaces, whose structures are larger than the wave width.</p>
