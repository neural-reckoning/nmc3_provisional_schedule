        <h1>Evidence accumulation in the human brain using a novel continuous dot-motion task</h1><h2>Maria Ruesseler</h2><h3> Tom Marshall, Department of Experimental Psychology- University of Oxford; Lilian Weber, Department of Psychiatry - University of Oxford; Jill O'Reilly, Department of Experimental Psychology - University of Oxford; Laurence Hunt, Department of Psychiatry - University of Oxford,</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Electrophysiological studies in non-human primates have shown that evidence accumulation is characterised by neural ramping activity that scales with sensory evidence. In humans the same ramping activity is reflected in the centro-parietal positivity (CPP) measured with EEG. However, when measuring the CPP subjects typically perform single trials, during which the amount of evidence presented is constant over time. In the natural world, the amount of evidence varies over time and it is not always clear over what timescale evidence needs to be accumulated. 

In this study, we investigated whether we could measure flexible changes in the CPP depending on how far back in time participants should accumulate sensory evidence. We designed a continuous evidence accumulation task in which the amount of evidence varies constantly. Participants have to detect stable phases in which evidence remains consistent for several seconds. Depending upon the statistics of the environment, subjects should vary their kernel of evidence integration. We aimed to retrieve the integration kernel participants used in different task environments directly from the EEG signal and the behaviour. Behavioural results show that participants adapt their strategy depending on the condition. A direct read-out of the integration kernel from the behaviour indicates that specifically the frequency of the stable phases has an effect on the integration kernel. In addition, we show that a centro-parietal signal tracks the continuous update of evidence which differs for different frequencies of the stable phases. This signal seems to be directly related to the decision process as it is much weaker for a distractor stimulus of random dot motion that is shown simultaneously with the decision relevant motion stimulus.
