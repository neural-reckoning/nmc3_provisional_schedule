        <h1>Batch Effects are Causal Effects: Applications in Human Functional Connectomes</h1><h2>Eric Bridgeford</h2><h3>Eric W. Bridgeford, Johns Hopkins University; Michael Powell, Johns Hopkins University; Anton Alyakin, Johns Hopkins University; Brian Caffo, Johns Hopkins University; Joshua T. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Batch effects, accidental sources of variance across multiple experiments, present a substantial hurdle for statistical inference. These batch effects have been implicated in multiple widespread problems, including the reproducibility crisis. Typical batch mitigation strategies, which normalize each dataset individually, view batch mitigation fundamentally as a statistical problem. We turn this view on its head, and cast batch effects as a causal problem, namely, the experimental site causes additional sources of variation, over and above the sources of variation within site. We applied this strategy to 24 datasets in the “Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility”. We illustrate that typical approaches amount to testing for independence, and therefore fail to address confounding variables. Such approaches are estimating the wrong estimand, and therefore, are invalid for quantifying batch effects when viewed from the causal perspective. Combining a causal view of batch mitigation with classical approaches (such as ComBat) yields satisfactory batch estimation and mitigation, while also preserving statistical patterns of interest. This framework can be applied to improve our understanding of the sources of batch effects, and enable more effective data aggregation strategies.
