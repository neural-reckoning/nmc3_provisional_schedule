        <h1>The strategy of learning a new visuomotor skill and the underlying neural mechanisms are age-dependent</h1><h2>Margot Bootsma</h2><h3>Simone R. Caljouw, University Medical Center Groningen; Menno P. Veldman, KU Leuven; Natasha M. Maurits, University Medical Center Groningen; John C. Rothwell, University College London; Tibor Hortobágyi, University Medical Center Groningen</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Motor learning is accompanied by experience-dependent neural plasticity of motor-related areas in the brain. Oscillatory brain activity in the alpha and beta frequency bands has been identified as a possible neural marker of this process. Although an age-specific increase in desynchronization of alpha and beta power during movement is frequently reported, if and how old age affects functional reorganization after a period of motor practice is incompletely understood. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine the effects of age on task-related brain activation before and after motor skill acquisition and at 24-h retention of a mirror star tracing task. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess task-related power (TR-Power) in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (12-30 Hz) frequency bands before, immediately after and 24-h after motor practice of a mirror star tracing task in younger (N=36, age=21.1±1.3yr) and older (N=36, age=70.4±4.1yr) adults. While both speed and accuracy of the motor task improved directly after practice in both age groups, younger adults only consolidated improvements in speed, whereas older adults only consolidated improvements in accuracy. In younger adults, task-related power was observed in the hemisphere contralateral to the practicing right hand, while older adults showed a more bilateral activation pattern. There was an increase in task-related alpha and beta desynchronization immediately, but not 24h after practice, indicative of early neural plasticity. Interestingly, this change in desynchronization after practice was larger for older compared to younger adults. Together, these results indicate that both the strategy for learning a mirror star tracing task as well as the underlying neural mechanisms are age-dependent. </p>
