        <h1>Modulation of deep mesencephalic nucleus to locomotor control in walking monkey</h1><h2>Rui-Han Wei</h2><h3>Erez Gugig, Johns Hopkins University;Oliver Stanley, Johns Hopkins University; Kathleen Cullen, Johns Hopkins University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The deep mesencephalic nucleus (DpMe), also termed the midbrain locomotor region (MLR), is a large area within the midbrain reticular which plays a key role in integrating and processing sensory, cognitive, and limbic inputs and in turn translating this information into a motor command adapted to our current environment. DpMe cells have been shown to respond to passive vestibular (rotational) stimuli, which suggests that this region plays an important role in vestibulo-motor control. However, DpMe responses to active movements, such as locomotion have not yet been characterized. Here we recorded continuous single unit extracellular activities from the DpMe in rhesus monkeys. First, we applied passive translations and rotation to characterize the vestibular responses of neurons in the DpMe. Head-mounted 3Dgyroscopes/3Daccelerometers were used to record the head motion, and neural sensitivities to passive vestibular modulation were computed. Second, we recorded from the same DPME neurons during head-fixed treadmill walking.  Four high-speed cameras were used for motion recording synchronously. Deep-learning computer-vision toolbox (DeepLabCut) were used to extract the animals' 3D posture for gait analysis. We found that, when compared to resting activities, DpMe cells demonstrated a significant overall increase in activity during head-fixed treadmill walking. Notably, DpMe cells demonstrated phase-dependent modulation during walking, even in the absence of vestibular stimulation. Modulation patterns varied between DpMe cells- some cells demonstrated peak activity during swing phase, and others during stance. Taken together these results suggest that DpMe neurons play a critical role in processing multi-sensory input during the complex sensorimotor activities generated in everyday life, such as walking. In addition, our findings also advance our knowledge of the neural circuits that coordinate gait and balance and thus have important implications for the development of novel treatments and interventions.</p>
