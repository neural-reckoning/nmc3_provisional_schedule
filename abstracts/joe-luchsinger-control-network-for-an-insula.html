        <h1>Control network for an insula-to-BNST stress coping circuit reveals a novel path for motor cortical control of affective circuitry</h1><h2>Joe Luchsinger</h2><h3>Joseph R. Luchsinger; Tracy L. Fetterly; Kellie M. Williford; Gregory J. Salimando; Jose Maldonado; Richard B. Simerly; Danny G. Winder; Samuel W. Centanni</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>All life forms must respond to stress to adapt and survive. Active stress coping responses involve motor planning and execution, and physical activity is known to modulate affective behavior. The impact of physical activity on affective behavior has been proposed to rely on peripheral metabolic feedback. Here we identify an insular cortex to BNST (insulaâ†’BNST) neuronal circuit recruited during active stress coping that modulates affective behavior. We outline a functional control network for this synapse, which is heavily represented by motor cortical regions, demonstrating a pathway by which motor circuitry and primary motor signals can regulate emotional or affective behavior through a feedforward rather than feedback process.</p>
