        <h1>Cortical Attention and Default Mode Networks in Focused Attention Meditators Assessed with fMRI</h1><h2>Kathryn Devaney</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Meditation experience correlates with improved performance on behavioral assessments of attention, but the neural bases of this improvement are unknown. Two prominent, competing attention networks exist in the human cortex: a dorsal 'focused attention' network and a ventral 'circuit-breaker' network by which stimuli can capture attention. Additionally, a third network, the default mode network, demonstrates deactivation during demanding tasks. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to contrast cortical network activation between experienced vipassana meditators and controls. Participants performed two standard attention tasks during scanning: a sustained attention task and an attention-capture task. Meditators demonstrated increased magnitude of differential activation in the dorsal attention vs. default mode network in a sustained attention task, relative to controls. In contrast, attentional reorienting did not reveal behavioral or attention network differences between meditators and controls. These results demonstrate increased stability in sustained attention processes without an associated attentional capture cost in meditators.</p>
