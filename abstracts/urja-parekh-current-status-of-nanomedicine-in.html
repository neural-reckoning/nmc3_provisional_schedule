        <h1>Current status of Nanomedicine in Glioblastoma Multiforme - A Systematic Review.</h1><h2>Urja Parekh</h2><h3>Dr Hrishikesh Sarkar, Senior Consultant Neurosurgeon Department of Neurological Sciences Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, 4 Bunglows, Mumbai, India  - 400061</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: With all the current therapeutic advancements, Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is still an incurable disease with a median overall survival of a mere 15 months. Owing to their small size, high surface to volume ratio and ability to cross the blood brain barrier, nanoparticles are being employed in therapeutics, diagnostics and theranostics for GBM.<br/>Objective: In this systematic review, we describe the basis and types of nanoparticles utilized for treatment of GBM and further evaluate the outcomes of clinical trials involving nanotherapy in patients with GBM.<br/>Methodology: Ten clinical trials conducted between 2001 until 2020 were analyzed the PRISMA 2009 guidelines. 225 patients were further sub-grouped as either primary or recurrent GBM.<br/>Results: The primary outcome of median overall survival (mOS) was 8.2 months for the pooled sample, 6.75 months for primary GBM and 9.7 months for recurrent GBM.  The median KPS improved from 80 to 90 after therapy.  Number of adverse events due to nanotherapy were n=32 (14.2%). The results show that existing nanotherapeutic strategies were able to extend the survival as well as quality of life with an acceptable adverse event rate.<br/>Conclusion: While nanotechnology has shown much potential in being a futuristic medicine to treat GBM, it is far from achieving superiority amongst other “second line” options. Possible reasons and future directions are discussed.</p>
