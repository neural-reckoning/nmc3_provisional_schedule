These behaviours have been linked to variation in cortico-amygdalar circuitry in typically developing children (TDC). Here, we examine whether cortico-amygdalar variation relates to internalizing and externalizing behaviours in children with different NDDs.<br/>Methods: Using data from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorder (POND) Network, we analyzed T1 weighted, resting state fMRI and diffusion weighted data from a transdiagnostic sample of children and youth (ages 6-18 years, n=157-346) with a primary diagnosis of ASD, ADHD, or OCD, and TDC. Cross-sectional behavioral assessments from the parent-report Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) and multi-modal imaging were used. Associations between externalizing or internalizing behavior and cortico-amygdalar network connectivity indices (i.e. structural covariance, functional connectivity white matter connectivity) were examined using linear regressions, controlling for age, gender, and modality specific covariates. <br/>Results: No significant associations (or diagnostic group-by-behavior interaction effects) were found between externalizing or internalizing behavior and any of the connectivity indices examined.<br/>Conclusions: The null results of the current study do not provide evidence of a shared relationship between cortico-amygdalar network connectivity properties and externalizing or internalizing behavior across a transdiagnostic sample of children and youth. Using larger sample sizes, comprehensive behavioral batteries, and shifting the theoretical framework for examining brain-behavior relationships in transdiagnostic samples may be necessary for delineating such relationships.<br/></p>
