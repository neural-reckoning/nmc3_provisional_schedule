        <h1>Segregation of current modules in modeling detailed single neuron models</h1><h2>Nathaniel Opsal (he/him)</h2><h3>Nate Opsal, University of Missouri; Pete Canfield, University of Missouri; Tyler Banks, University of Missouri; Satish S. Nair, University of Missouri</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Biophysical conductance-based models of neuron can provide improved realism in network models to investigate neuronal oscillations. Such single cell models vary in morphological complexity from single compartment to ones that have over 1000 compartments. Computational overheads necessitate the use of reduced order single cells in large model neuronal networks. However, in such cases, it is important that the reduced order models selected retain the key biophysical properties of biological cells.  We had previously hypothesized that in a single neuron, different sets of current modules might be responsible for maintaining neurocomputational properties such as resting potential, sub-threshold oscillations, and spiking behaviors. An approach termed the ‘segregation methods’ was designed using the hypothesis and tested successfully on several single cell models reported in the literature (Alturki et al., 2016).

Here we add to the segregation approach for designing current ‘modules’ by developing a new module to design bursts and other burst-like waveforms. We provide an example of a pyramidal neuron in the CA3 region of the hippocampus which is shown to respond to stimuli with a doublet at the start followed by tonic spiking, a characteristic neural signature. Furthermore, we investigate the functional significance of the doublet by embedding the single cell model into a previously developed hippocampal network model. We find that the doublet is critical for generating theta in the hippocampal model. A long-term goal is to develop a publicly accessible software tool that automates the process of designing a single cell using the segregation approach.
