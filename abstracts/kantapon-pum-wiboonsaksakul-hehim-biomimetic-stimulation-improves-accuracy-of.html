        <h1>Biomimetic stimulation improves accuracy of vestibular prosthesis-evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) responses</h1><h2>Kantapon Pum Wiboonsaksakul (he/him)</h2><h3>Dale C Roberts, Johns Hopkins University; Charles C Della Santina, Johns Hopkins University; Kathleen E Cullen, Johns Hopkins University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The vestibular system is crucial for maintaining visual stability via the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).  Accordingly, patients with bilateral vestibulopathy suffer debilitating oscillopsia and dizziness. To improve patients’ quality of life, one emerging approach is a prosthesis that senses head rotation and transforms the movement into vestibular afferent stimulation, substituting for the damaged periphery. Though such devices can partially restore VOR function, current approaches do not represent the specific high-pass dynamics by which actual vestibular afferents encode head motion. We hypothesized that a more biomimetic design would improve performance. To test this, we incorporated afferent-like dynamics into our vestibular prosthesis. Two rhesus monkeys with bilateral vestibular hypofunction were implanted with unilateral prosthesis (targeting horizontal canal afferents). At 7 rotation frequencies (0.2 – 20 Hz), we recorded the VOR eye movements evoked by 5 different mappings: 1) no dynamics (constant gain and no phase lead), 2) regular afferent-like dynamics, 3) irregular afferent-like dynamics, 4) the combination of the two, and 5) very high-pass irregular dynamics. The gain and phase of the evoked VOR response were then analyzed. All 4 afferent-like mappings yielded constant gains up to ~5 Hz while the gains remained constant only up to 1 Hz without the afferent-like dynamics. The phase of the 4 biomimetic mappings was more compensatory (temporally precise) across a range of frequencies. In contrast, the mapping without dynamics did not maintain accurate timing and showed increasing phase lag as a function of frequency, consistent with an uncompensated fixed delay. Overall, our results show that a mapping that mimics regular afferents best maintains the VOR gain and compensatory phase response across frequencies. Further, our results have a direct clinical significance, providing support for a more biomimetic approach to improve prosthesis performance and, in turn, functional outcomes of patients with bilateral vestibulopathy.</p>
