        <h1>Spontaneous shifts of arousal state shape behavior in perceptual decision-making</h1><h2>Ella Podvalny</h2><h3>Ella Podvalny; Leana E. King; Biyu J. He</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Arousal levels perpetually rise and fall to control behavior. While extreme arousal states clearly indicate behavioral extremes, from sleep to escape from danger, little is known about the behavioral relevance of intermediate arousal levels fluctuating spontaneously in waking humans. Here, we simultaneously monitored magnetoencephalography and pupil size in healthy volunteers (N=24) at rest and during a perceptual decision-making task with long inter-trial intervals. We first identified how the two commonly used markers of arousal - pupil size and spectral power of brain activity – relate to one another at rest, and then show how prestimulus fluctuations in these markers shape subsequent perceptual decisions. We found that spontaneously varying pupil size correlates with power of brain activity in all frequency bands and in all large-scale cortical networks. Prestimulus pupil size correlates with subsequent shifts in detection bias (c) and sensitivity (d’), which was fully explained by large-scale spectral power variation. When dissociated from pupil-linked state, delta power of dorsal attention and default networks predicts bias and alpha power of visual network predicts sensitivity. Spontaneous pupil constriction and dilation events correlate with large-scale brain activity as well, but not with behavior. Our results illuminate the large-scale electrophysiological neural correlates of pupil-linked arousal and show the effects of arousal states on human perceptual decision-making. </p>
