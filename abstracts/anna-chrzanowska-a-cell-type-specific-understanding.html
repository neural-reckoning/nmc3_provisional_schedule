        <h1>A cell-type specific understanding of innate defensive behaviors: the collicular perspective</h1><h2>Anna Chrzanowska</h2><h3>Arnau Sans-Dublanc, NERF, KULeuven (Belgium); Katja Reinhard, NERF, KULeuven, VIB (Belgium); Dani Lemmon, NERF, University of Antwerp (Belgium); Gabriel Montaldo, NERF, imec (Belgium), Alan Urban, NERF, KULeuven, VIB (Belgium); Karl Farrow, NERF, KULeuven, VIB, imec</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Animalsâ€™ behaviors are governed by distinct neuronal cell-types. In the superior colliculus of mice, there is evidence of a strong relationship between individual cell-types and orienting, hunting and defensive behaviors. Here we use this relationship to determine the contribution each collicular cell-type make on triggering behavior. We show that optogenetic activation of 4 different cell populations each evoked a distinct behavior, including freezing, stopping, hiding and orienting. Additionally, by combining optogenetics with functional ultrasound imaging (opto-fUSi) we mapped the neuronal activity in up to 264 brain regions and unraveled a few novel hubs engaged in defensive behaviors processing. Chemogenetic manipulation of one newly identified area, the posterior paralaminar nuclei of the thalamus (PPnT), revealed the role it plays in mediating habituation to repeated threat-like input from the superior colliculus. This study extends our understanding of how cell-types of the superior colliculus disseminate information across the brain to guide distinct behaviors.</p>
