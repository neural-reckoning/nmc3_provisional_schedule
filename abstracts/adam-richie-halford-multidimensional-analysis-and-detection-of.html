        <h1>Multidimensional analysis and detection of informative features in diffusion MRI measurements of human white matter</h1><h2>Adam Richie-Halford</h2><h3>Jason Yeatman, Stanford University; Noah Simon, University of Washington; Ariel Rokem, University of Washington</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of white matter connections (Yeatman et al. 2012). Tractometry results are usually analyzed using mass univariate approaches, computed separately for each point along tracts (Colby et al. 2012), akin to fMRI voxel-wise analysis. Alternatively, an a priori hypothesis is used, where tissue properties are computed for a specific tract of interest. In the present work, we introduce a method based on the Sparse Group Lasso (SGL; Simon et al., 2013) that selects informative features by enforcing sparsity, both at the level of individual tracts and across the entire set of tracts, thereby recovering the minimal set of anatomical features to make accurate predictions. Our method presents a significant departure from previous analysis of tractometry data: rather than providing p-values for each individual location in the brain, the statistical accuracy of this method focuses on the accuracy of the predictions of phenotypic data.<br/><br/>We validated our approach in both regression and classification settings. An example dataset for classification contained data from 24 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 24 matched controls (Sarica et al. 2017). An example dataset for regression contained data from 76 healthy subjects, ranging between 6 years and 50 years of age and a validation dataset contained 641 healthy subjects from the Cam-CAN dataset. In the classification setting, we demonstrate that this method competes with previous results without the need for a priori feature engineering. Moreover, it automatically identifies well-known features of the disease. In the regression setting, the data can be used to accurately predict "brain age". Thus, this multivariate approach both (a) achieves high cross-validated accuracy for precision medicine applications of dMRI data and (b) identifies relevant features of brain anatomy to further our neuroscientific understanding of clinical disorders.</p>
