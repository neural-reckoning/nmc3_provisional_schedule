        <h1>Machine Learning Framework for Fully Automatic Quality Control of Registrations in Big Data brain MRI</h1><h2>Sudhakar Tummala</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In analysis of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, rigid and affine registration of individual subject’s brain to a reference brain is a vital step in pre-processing stage. In general, the registered images could be checked manually or semi-manually for quality of alignment. However, this visual quality control becomes a tedious process when we deal with big data MRI processing containing thousands of images. Therefore, there is a strong need to fully automate this quality checking process. Hence, I propose to develop and deploy different machine learning (ML) classifiers for quality checking of both rigid and affine registrations. 
Firstly, the cost functions such as normalized cross-correlation, normalized mutual information and correlation ratio are computed by comparing the subject’s registration to the template with the template. These cost values are computed locally at a 3x3x3 volume of interest (VOI) and further moving this VOI with a stride of 3. Final cost value is the average of cost values obtained in each VOI. Further, these are also the features used for training different ML classifiers including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machine, kNN, random forest, Gaussian naive bayes. These ML classifiers are 5-fold cross validated on a subset of T1-weighted MRI data from autism brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE I) consisting of 220 images. These images were rigidly and affinely transformed to the template by using the FSL interface in Nipype. Further, 220 incorrectly registered images were generated by changing the values in transformation matrices and then applying these modified matrices to register the image to the template. 
All ML classifiers achieved a testing accuracy of 99.9 % for both rigid and affine registrations. Eventually, these trained ML models  could be deployed for automatic quality checking of image registrations involving big data there by eliminating the need for manual intervention.</p>
