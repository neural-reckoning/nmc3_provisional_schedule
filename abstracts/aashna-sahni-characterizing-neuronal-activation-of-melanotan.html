        <h1>Characterizing Neuronal Activation of Melanotan II, a Novel Pharmaceutical Drug with the Potential to Enhance the Efficacy of Autism Therapy</h1><h2>Aashna Sahni</h2><h3>Charles L. Ford, Anna A. McDonnough, Jamie LaPrairie, Larry J. Young</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p><br/>There is no effective pharmaceutical drug that can palliate the social deficits caused by autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Oxytocin (OT), a neuropeptide, promotes pro-social behaviors making it a potential candidate for pharmacological treatment. Melanotan II (MTII) is a compound of interest that evokes endogenous OT release in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Regions of the social salience network (SSN) coordinate to process social information. MTII primes PVN to release OT throughout the (SSN). MTII combined with social stimulus, increases OT releases throughout the SSN. MTII- induced pattern of brain activation was investigated across the SSN with social exposure. Twenty-four prairie voles received MTII doses ranging from 0.1 nmol to 1 pmol into lateral ventricles and were exposed to social or non-social stimuli. To observe activation, immunolabelling was performed to label for OT expression and c-FOS, an immediate early gene protein used as proxy for neuronal activation. Behavioral side effects were observed: stretching, spinning, scratching, grooming, and ambulating. Decrease in side effects was observed with decrease in dosage. To analyze c-FOS expression an online machine learning program, DeepFLaSH was used. Results suggested no behavioral difference between vehicle and 1 pmol group making it a viable dose for future experiments. However, a quantitative analysis of c-FOS expression suggested there was no significant difference in expression at different doses. We concluded the behavioral differences observed at different doses were not correlated with increased c-FOS expression in the PVN. In future, we will examine MTII-induced activation of c-FOS expression in other regions of the SSN. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p>
