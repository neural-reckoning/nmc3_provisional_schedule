        <h1>Delayed maturation of input plasticity at lateral perforant path synapses onto adult-born dentate granule neurons.</h1><h2>Nicholas Vyleta</h2><h3>Jason Snyder, University of British Columbia</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In the mammalian brain, the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus uniquely generates new neurons throughout the lifetime of the animal. Adult-born granule cells undergo a period of maturation during which their membranes are more excitable and inputs from medial perforant path neurons can more easily induce long-term potentiation of synaptic responses. This previously described “critical window” exists between approximately four- and six-weeks of cell age. Whether signaling from the other major cortical input to the dentate gyrus—the lateral perforant path—undergoes the same timecourse of maturation remains unknown. We measured synaptic responses to lateral perforant path stimulation on adult-born granule cells between three- and thirty-weeks old. Surprisingly, we find that long-term potentiation of synaptic responses matures over an extended timecourse, with a peak at around 15-weeks of cell age. Cells between 4- and 6- weeks of age are more likely to experience long-term depression of lateral perforant path inputs than are older cells. We find that facilitation of transmitter release increases over a similar timecourse as long-term potentiation, and that the magnitude of the reduction of facilitation after induction of long-term potentiation predicts the magnitude of that potentiation. These data suggest that an increase in presynaptic release probability at lateral perforant path synapses is the major mechanism of long-term potentiation, and that this plasticity is more prominent at inputs onto older neurons. </p>
