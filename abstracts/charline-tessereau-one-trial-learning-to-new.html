        <h1>One-trial learning to new goal locations on a simulated delayed matching to place watermaze task by using minimal additions to an actor-critic architecture. </h1><h2>Charline Tessereau</h2><h3>Stephen Coombes, School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham; Reuben O'Dea,  School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham; Tobias Bast, School of psychology, University of Nottingham </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Animals, including humans, are able to learn new spatial locations after a single visit [1,2,6]. This property, also termed one-shot learning, is challenging to capture in artificial agents in biologically realistic set-ups, and its underlying mechanisms are the focus of ongoing experimental and theoretical research. Here, we present an  approach to modelling spatial learning and navigation of an agent in a circular open field maze, using Temporal Difference (TD) learning within an actor-critic architecture (using a discrete action-space adapted from [3] and a continuous action-space adapted from [6] implemented via a rate, rather than spiking, framework) [7]. This architecture enables to map locations to actions to reach a fixed goal in the space, leading to behaviours close to the one of rats in the standard memory test of the Morris watermaze [3]. However, this agent requires many trials to adjust to changing goal locations, therefore failing to reproduce one-shot learning as observed in the watermaze delayed-matching-to-place (DMP) task [1,2,6]. We present two minimal additions which enable to adjust to changing goal locations. First, a map-like representation of locations is used to compute a vector-based direction to the goal [3]. Second, a meta-critic unit [5] which shapes the exploration of the agent and selects a successful policy for the current situation. We compare the behaviour of these agents to the behaviour of rats in the watermaze DMP task. <br/><br/><br/>[1] Bast, T., Wilson, I. A., Witter, M. P., and Morris, R. G. (2009).
