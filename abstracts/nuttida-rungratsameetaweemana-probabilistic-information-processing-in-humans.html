        <h1>Probabilistic Information Processing in Humans and Recurrent Neural Networks</h1><h2>Nuttida Rungratsameetaweemana</h2><h3>Robert Kim, Salk Institute for Biological Studies; Terrence J. Sejnowski, Salk Institute for Biological Studies</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In nature, sensory inputs are often highly structured, and statistical regularities of these signals can be extracted to form expectations about future sensori-motor associations, thereby facilitating optimal behavior. To date, the circuit mechanisms that underlie these probabilistic computations are not well understood. Through human  electrophysiolgical  experiment  and  a  recurrent  neural  network  (RNN) model, the present study investigates how the brain extracts, processes, and utilizes probabilistic  structures  of  sensory  signals  to  guide  behavior.  To  achieve  this goal, we first constructed and trained a biophysically constrained RNN model to perform a probabilistic decision-making task similar to the paradigm used in the human data.  Specifically, the training environment was probabilistic such that one stimulus was more probable than the others. We show that both humans and the RNN model successfully extract information about stimulus probability and integrate this knowledge into their decisions and task strategy in a new environment. Specifically, performance of both humans and the RNN model varied with the degree to which the stimulus probability of the new environment matched the formed expectations. In both humans and RNNs, this expectation effect was more prominent when the strength of sensory evidence was low. These findings suggest that both humans and our RNN model placed more emphasis on prior expectations (top-down signals) when the available sensory information (bottom-up signals) was limited.  Finally, by dissecting the trained RNN model, we demonstrate how competitive inhibition and recurrent excitation form the basis for neural circuitry optimized to perform probabilistic information processing.</p>
