        <h1>Altered dynamic architecture of functional connectivity for predicting recovery of consciousness in behaviorally unresponsive patients</h1><h2>Charlotte Maschke (she/her)</h2><h3>Stefanie Blain-Moraes, School of Physical and Occupational Therapy,  McGill University Montreal</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The brain is an inherently dynamic and time-varying organ, whose functionality is based on patterns of spatially and temporally differentiated activity. In individuals with disorders of consciousness (DOC), the dynamic properties of functional connectivity of their brain networks are altered. Accurate assessment of level of consciousness in unresponsive patients and their potential to recover requires further understanding of the dynamic architecture of functional connectivity. In this study, we investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of dynamic properties of functional connectivity in individuals in an unresponsive or minimally responsive state. Time-resolved functional connectivity was estimated from high-density EEG using the weighted phase lag index (wPLI). The spatial-temporal organization of wPLI connectivity was assessed with a K-means clustering analysis and compared between 1) healthy adults; 2) DOC patients who recovered consciousness; 3) DOC patients who remained unresponsive; and 4) patients showing cognitive-motor dissociation. The robustness of the results was further evaluated using a hidden Markov model. We demonstrate that the dynamic organization of functional connectivity varies widely in DOC patients, and that these patterns differs from those which are observed in healthy adults. We demonstrate that the degree of preserved dynamic organization of time-resolved functional connectivity distinguishes unresponsive patients according to their state of consciousness and potential to recover consciousness. Our findings provide evidence for altered spatial-temporal patterns and dynamic properties of functional connectivity in unresponsive individuals. The maintenance of the brains inherently dynamic and time-variable organization contains valuable information for the accurate assessment of an individual's level of consciousness and the potential to recover consciousness.</p>
