        <h1>Neurotransmitter switches regulate motor learning and stress response</h1><h2>Huiquan Li</h2><h3>Wuji Jiang, University of California, San Diego; Cong Chen, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California San Diego; Don Cleveland, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, University of California San Diego; Nicholas C. Spitzer, University of California, San Diego</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neurotransmitter switching, involving the loss of one neurotransmitter and gain of another in the same neuron, is a form of plasticity that regulates E/I balance and behavior (Li & Spitzer, 2020; Spitzer, 2017). We have identified neurotransmitter switching and its behavioral consequences in both healthy and stressed brains during adulthood. <br/>We find that one week of voluntary wheel running enhances the acquisition of motor skills in healthy adult mice. Running for one week also induces switching from acetylcholine to GABA expression in neurons in the midbrain pedunculopontine nucleus. Using viral vectors to override transmitter switching, either by expressing the enzymes for acetylcholine synthesis, or short hairpin RNAs interfering with the gain of enzymes for GABA synthesis, blocks the beneficial effect of running on motor skill learning (Li & Spitzer, 2020). These results show that neurotransmitter switching provides the basis by which sustained running benefits motor skill learning.<br/>Under conditions of stress, we find that transmitter switching occurs following a traumatic fear experience. Two and four weeks after intense footshock stress, a subset of serotonergic neurons in the lateral wings of the dorsal raphe (lwDR) of adult mice have switched their co-transmitter from glutamate/vGluT3 (vesicular glutamate transporter type 3) to GABA/GAD67 (glutamic acid decarboxylase 67). At both time points, shocked mice show fear-related passive behaviors as they reduce exploration and increase freezing in a novel environment. We are now using Cre-dependent adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to express vGluT3 or suppress expression of GAD1 that encodes GAD67 in serotonergic lwDR neurons and testing the impact on the stress-induced sustained fear responses.<br/>Our studies suggest that neurotransmitter switching, as a form of brain plasticity, links prior experience to subsequent alterations of behavior. We expect this research to lead to new insights into development of therapeutic methods for treating movement disorders and mental illnesses.</p>
