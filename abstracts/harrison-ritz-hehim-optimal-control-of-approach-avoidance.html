        <h1>Optimal control of approach-avoidance dynamics</h1><h2>Harrison Ritz (He/Him)</h2><h3>Amitai Shenhav; Benjamin Hayden; Seng Bum Yoo </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Animals must continuously adjust their behavior to pursue potential rewards (e.g., chasing prey) while evading potential threats (e.g., avoiding predators). To behave optimally, animals must also use their knowledge about the dynamics of their environment (e.g., a predators’ agility) to guide their actions. The current experiment seeks to develop a computational framework for understanding this goal pursuit.<br/><br/>Computational models of approach-avoid behaviors have been largely limited to describing simplified economic choices, without providing a clear understanding of how continuous actions are controlled across time. Our approach leverages engineering algorithms from Optimal Control Theory, a framework also used in computational models of online motor control. These models are inherently well-suited for describing the continuous dynamics of natural behavior, while being far less computationally demanding than model-based planning over discretized states and actions.<br/><br/>In the current project, we sought to understand how rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) played a dynamic predator-prey computer game. Monkeys controlled an avatar with a joystick, chasing a prey avatar to gain juice and evading a predator avatar to avoid a timeout. We used Inverse Optimal Control to infer the valuation of prey capture and predator avoidance that best explained monkeys' actions under a standard optimal control algorithm (iLQR). Our model predicted the monkeys’ full trajectories well above chance, including in held-out trials. The model’s inferred values on prey and predator were also significantly correlated with the amount of reward and punishment at stake, reflecting the animals’ understanding of the task.<br/><br/>Optimal control theory offers rational process models for translating appetitive and aversive goals into extended behaviors, while maintaining computational feasibility. These models make testable predictions about the representations necessary for control and provide a normative baseline against which to compare alternative accounts, catalyzing our understanding of how animals pursue their goals.</p>
