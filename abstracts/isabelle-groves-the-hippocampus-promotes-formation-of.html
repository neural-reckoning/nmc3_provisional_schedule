        <h1>The hippocampus promotes formation of long-term memory for objects in rats by preventing sensory interference after learning</h1><h2>Isabelle Groves</h2><h3>Daisy Arkell, University of Edinburgh, Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences and Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain; Emma Wood, University of Edinburgh, Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences and Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain; Oliver Hardt, McGill University, Patrick Wild Centre and Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Damage to the medial temporal lobe, notably the hippocampus, often leads to anterograde amnesia for declarative memories, but it remains unresolved how this deficit arises. Addressing this issue, we have proposed in our active decay theory that the hippocampus supports long-term memory formation by protecting against ongoing sensory stimulation which interferes with the stabilisation of newly formed content representations residing in extra-hippocampal areas. Efficient pattern separation within the hippocampus is predicted to promote resistance to interference and representation overlap. Thus, without a functioning hippocampus, ongoing sensory stimulation will lead to states of catastrophic interference in these brain regions, manifesting behaviourally as anterograde amnesia. Here, we report our results testing this hypothesis with an object recognition task in rats as a model for human declarative memories. Importantly, expression of long-term object recognition memory requires the perirhinal cortex, not the hippocampus in rats. We found (1) that inactivating hippocampus prior to object learning with intrahippocampal injections of GABAA and -B agonists (muscimol+baclofen) impaired object recognition tested 24 h after learning. (2) This deficit was absent when we placed rats into a highly familiar dark chamber right after object learning to reduce sensory stimulation during the memory stabilization period. Our findings support our theoretical model and suggest that anterograde amnesia due to hippocampal damage arises from heightened vulnerability to interference from ongoing sensory stimulation during phases of memory stabilization.</p>
