Lerch</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Despite promise in animal models, novel therapeutics consistently fail in clinical trials of autism. Due to the heterogeneous nature of autism, treatment will likely only ameliorate symptoms in a subset of patients. There is a need to simultaneously test promising new compounds while understanding and predicting which patients will respond to each therapy. To determine what might contribute to response susceptibility, we propose the implementation of co-clinical trials in autism. In co-clinical trials, novel compounds, with established safety profiles, are simultaneously tested in mouse models of autism as well as in Phase 2 trials in humans with autism. A high-throughput protocol for mouse models of autism is discussed, which encompasses chronic treatment over development, multiple magnetic resonance imaging time-points, and behavioural tests before, during, and after treatment. Human subjects also follow an extensive phenotyping protocol, including behavioural testing, as well as genetics and imaging assessments. This multi-modal, multi-species approach is designed to be a rigorous method of assessing treatment effect, with the intention of stratification by response susceptibility. The considerations of the co-clinical trials is discussed, focusing on the trials and tribulations of the model, as well as lessons-learned. The hope is to introduce the concept of co-clinical trials to the field of autism, creating a shift in our current approach to the treatment of the disorder.</p>
