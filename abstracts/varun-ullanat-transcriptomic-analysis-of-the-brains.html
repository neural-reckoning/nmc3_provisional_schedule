        <h1>Transcriptomic Analysis of the brains of Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s Patients</h1><h2>Varun Ullanat</h2><h3>Ryna S</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s diseases (Asym-AD) is a condition where patients have intact cognition but neuropathology similar to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Studying the genome-wide expression of transcripts in Asym-AD brains could help us understand the molecular mechanisms that play a role in the onset of AD. Microarray expression counts from the entorhinal, temporal, cerebellum and frontal regions of the brain is taken for AD, Asym-AD and Normal (control) patients collected from the GEO database. The gene expression of the three conditions are compared as three different cases: AD versus Asym-AD, AD versus control and Asym-AD versus control. All analysis was done using the R software. Differential gene expression (DGE) and Co-expression is first done to analyse the abnormalities in the transcriptome. Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is done to find out the significant pathways and modules. Finally, protein-protein interaction networks are constructed to identify potential network hubs for targeting. Neuronal pathways including postsynaptic signal transduction, transmission across synapses and release of neurotransmitters were affected in all cases, and some interesting pathways such as Innate immunity and Neutrophil degranulation was found to be altered in the Asymptomatic AD versus control case. This could suggest an immunological basis for the Asymptomatic AD as a cause or direct side effect of AD neuropathology.  </p>
