        <h1>Mechanism of Temporal Interference stimulation using in-vitro and in silico model of hippocampal gamma oscillation</h1><h2>Zeinab Esmaeilpour</h2><h3>Greg Kronberg, City college of New York; Davide Reato,Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, Neuroscience Program, Lisbon, Portuga; lucas C parra, city college of New York; Marom Bikson, city college of New York</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>It has been suggested that transcranial electrical stimulation using Temporal Interferential (TI) stimulation can be leveraged in neuromodulation of deep brain regions where the two high-frequency (kHz) electric fields intersect, and form Amplitude-Modulated waveform with low beating frequency (tens of Hz). However, superficial regions are exposed to higher magnitude but unmodulated sine waveform with a steady amplitude. The mechanisms through which CNS could be sensitive to Amplitude-Modulated with kHz carrier frequency but not unmodulated sinusoidal waveform is not yet understood. Explaining the cellular mechanism of Amplitude-Modulated high-frequency stimulation is thus of interest in developing rational optimized stimulation strategies. The effect of Amplitude-Modulated high-frequency electric fields on ongoing network activity was evaluated in carbachol-induced gamma oscillation in CA3a region of rat hippocampal slices. Extracellular local field potentials were analyzed before, during and after 2 s of stimulation. We tested unmodulated sine waveforms with low frequency (i.e. 5 Hz), kHz frequency (i.e. 1 and 2 kHz) and 5 Hz Amplitude-Modulated waveforms with 0.1, 1, and 2 kHz carrier frequencies. A validated MRI-derived head model predicted both peak electric fields in the cortex and depth of Amplitude-Modulation at deep regions during TI. We further developed a computational model of excitatory/inhibitory neuronal network with conductance-based synaptic interactions to explain the experimental results. Both experiment and model confirmed the hypothesis that spatial selectivity of temporal interference stimulation depends on the phasic modulation of neural oscillations only in deep brain regions. Adaptation mechanism (e.g. GABAb) enhanced sensitivity to amplitude modulated waveform in contrast to unmodulated kHz and produced selectivity in modulating gamma oscillation. Selection of carrier frequency strongly affected sensitivity to amplitude modulation stimulation. The TI sensitivity (current required at the scalp) depends on the active neuronal membrane time-constant approaching the kHz carrier frequency.</p>
