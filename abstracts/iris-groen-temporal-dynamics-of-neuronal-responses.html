        <h1>Temporal dynamics of neuronal responses in human visual cortex</h1><h2>Iris Groen</h2><h3>Giovanni Piantoni, University Medical Center Utrecht; Stephanie Montenegro, New York University School of Medicine; Adeen Flinker, New York University School of Medicine; Sasha Devore, New York University School of Medicine; Orrin Devinsky, New York University School of Medicine; Werner Doyle, New York University School of Medicine;  Nick Ramsey, University Medical Center Utrecht; Natalia Petridou, University Medical Center Utrecht; Jonathan Winawer, New York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Cortical responses to visual stimuli exhibit complex temporal dynamics, including sub-additive temporal summation, adaptation, and slower dynamics for suboptimal stimuli. Multiple computational models have been proposed to account for these dynamics in several measurement domains, including single-cell recordings, psychophysics, and fMRI. It is challenging to compare these models because of differences in model form, test stimuli, and instrument. Here we present a new dataset that is well-suited to compare neural models of temporal dynamics. The dataset is from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings of human visual cortex, which measures cortical population responses with high spatial and temporal precision. The stimuli were large, static contrast patterns that varied systematically in contrast and duration for single-pulse trials, and in inter-stimulus interval (ISI) for paired-pulse trials. Time-varying broadband responses were computed using the power envelope of the band-pass filtered voltage time course (50-170 Hz) recorded from 126 electrodes in total across eleven epilepsy patients, covering earlier (V1-V3) and higher-order (LO, TO, IPS) retinotopic maps. In all visual regions, the ECoG broadband responses show several non-linear features: peak response amplitude saturates with high contrast and long stimulus durations; response latency decreases with increasing contrast; and the response to a second stimulus is suppressed for short ISIs and recovers for longer ISIs. These non-linear response features were well predicted by a model consisting of a small set of canonical neuronal operations: linear filtering, rectification, exponentiation, and delayed normalization. These results demonstrate that a simple computational model captures a wide range of temporal and contrast-dependent neuronal dynamics at millisecond resolution. Finally, we present a software repository that implements models of temporal dynamics in a modular fashion, enabling the comparison of many models fit to the same ECoG data and analyzed with the same methods.</p>
