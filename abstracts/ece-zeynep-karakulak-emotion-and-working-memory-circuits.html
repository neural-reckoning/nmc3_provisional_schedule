        <h1>Emotion and Working Memory Circuits Examined via Inhibition Tasks in Prefrontal Cortex: An fNIRS Study</h1><h2>Ece Zeynep Karakulak</h2><h3>Kubra Kadak, Istanbul Medipol University; Lutfu Hanoglu, Istanbul Medipol University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Emotion is a wide hub involving limbic system and neocortical structures and shares a part of functional network with cognition. Neuropsychological studies have shown that emotion and cognition processes are both appearent in the prefrontal cortex. Although they are overlapping seperate functions, recent neuroimaging studies present a wide literature on mutual or adjacent brain areas host these feaures. In this study, we aimed to show whether inhibition processes are shared on PFC during event related emotional and color-word Stroop tasks. We collected fNIRS data from prefrontal regions of 5 healthy young people without any neuropsychiatric conditions. Emotional Stroop task presented via happy and sad faces with congruent and incongruent words in the middle of the picture. In color-word Stroop task, we used color words painted in red, yellow, green and blue. We requested from participants to tap 1 for congruent and 2 for incongruent trials. All analyzing processes applied using NIRSLAB. fNIRS data are filtered, averaged and then contrasted in a binary model in which incongruent trials are main sets and congruent trials are substracted properties for SPM. We observed right dorsolateral prefrontal area is the most differentiated region regarding oxyhemoglobin concentration change during both inhibition tasks when right dorsomedial prefrontal and left inferior frontal areas are additionally distinguished in emotional Stroop task. The present data indicates that there is shared cortical networks especially on right PFC during emotional and cognitive conflict monitoring while emotional processing also requires medial-frontal structures. Further research studies should consider fNIRS as a comprehensive method for assessing higher cognitive functions.</p>
