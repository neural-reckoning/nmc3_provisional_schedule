        <h1>Predicting basal forebrain degeneration with plasma lipids in human Alzheimer's disease</h1><h2>Hayley Shanks (She)</h2><h3>Kate M Onuska, Western University; Dinesh K Barupal, Icahn School of Medicine at Mt Sinai; Taylor W Schmitz, Western University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Cortical cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain is essential for normal cognitive functioning. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), basal forebrain cholinergic neurons degenerate before other neurotransmitter systems. Currently, our understanding as to what factors contribute to cholinergic selective vulnerability is limited. One proposed characteristic of cholinergic neurons which may render them more vulnerable to degeneration than other neurons is their dual use for the lipid phosphatidylcholine. While all neurons use phosphatidylcholine to build and repair their cell membranes, only cholinergic neurons use phosphatidylcholines to biosynthesize acetylcholine. <br/>Therefore, we hypothesized that if cholinergic neurons are selectively vulnerable to degeneration because of their high demand for phosphatidylcholines, then phosphatidylcholines should predict degeneration within the basal forebrain in human AD. To test our hypothesis, we leveraged multimodal data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Participants were divided into a normal cerebrospinal fluid (nCSF) group and an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) group based on their CSF ratios of phosphorylated tau and amyloid beta. We then quantified each participant’s longitudinal grey matter degeneration, indexed with structural magnetic resonance imaging. Multivariate pattern analyses determined that plasma phosphatidylcholines predict longitudinal trajectories of basal forebrain grey matter integrity (p = 0.001 on 5000 permutation tests). Furthermore, this relationship was moderated by the presence of CSF pathology. Overall, this study provides in vivo evidence for a relationship between phosphatidylcholines and the structural integrity of the basal forebrain in human AD. This work supports a longstanding theory of cholinergic selective vulnerability to AD.<br/></p>
