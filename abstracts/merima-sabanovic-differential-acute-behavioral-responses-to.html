        <h1>Differential acute behavioral responses to (±)-DOI injected in a novel or familiar environment</h1><h2>Merima Sabanovic</h2><h3>David Bannerman, University of Oxford; Mark Walton, University of Oxford; Jason Lerch, University of Oxford; Vladyslav Vyazovskiy, University of Oxford</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Serotonergic psychedelics induce profound changes at multiple levels of neuroplasticity that putatively aid lasting remission from a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders. In humans, heightened neuroplasticity was linked to heightened environmental sensitivity of acute and long-term psychedelic effects to both emotional/mental and physical context in which the treatment occurs, but such non-pharmacological factors of psychedelic response have been largely overlooked in animal models that remain crucial for discoveries on mechanisms of drug action. 

Familiarity is one of the main environmental factors emphasized in clinical settings. In this study, we investigated whether familiarity of the environmental context during administration of psychedelic (±)-DOI would modulate measures of psychedelic effects in mice – head-twitch (HTR) and ear-scratch (ESR) responses – as well as any changes in locomotive exploration and interaction with novel objects. To do this, one group of wild-type C57BL/6J male mice was habituated to the injection context extensively prior to testing whereas the context was novel for the second group.

2mg/kg (±)-DOI induced a locomotor suppression regardless of injection context, but ESR to 2mg/kg (±)-DOI was higher in the non-habituated than in habituated animals, with a similar trend observable for HTR. Additionally, 2mg/kg (±)-DOI reduced novel object interaction in habituated animals, hypothetically signalling a cognitive shift from external processing of the environment to internal processing of emotional states and mind-generated stimuli. In non-habituated animals, vehicle control group had lower object interaction than habituated controls, likely due to attention competition for exploring both the novel environment and the novel objects, but (±)-DOI did not induce further drops in interaction times.

To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first attempt of investigating the effect of familiarity of the drug injection environment in mice on both the acute behavioural responses to a psychedelic drug and on the accompanying changes in exploration. A subsequent ex vivo imaging study will also be a first attempt to look at environmental effects on brain structure. 

In my presentation I will also outline our future studies investigating whether (±)-DOI can influence structural brain plasticity and cognitive plasticity, referring to an increased capability for flexible cognitive change, in the long-term, after the drug has cleared the system. </p>
