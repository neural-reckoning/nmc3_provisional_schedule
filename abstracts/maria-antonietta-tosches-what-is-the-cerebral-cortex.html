        <h1>What is the cerebral cortex? A perspective from reptiles and amphibians</h1><h2>Maria Antonietta Tosches</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Vertebrates emerged more than 500 million years ago, and colonized water, land and air. Despite their diverse life histories, vertebrates share the same overall brain architecture, which is established during early embryonic development. Are correspondences, or homologies, extending beyond coarse brain regions, to the level of cell types and circuits? To address this question, we are studying cell types in the telencephalon, a brain region where the dramatic expansion of neuronal diversity in evolution is associated to morphological and functional novelties. We used single-cell transcriptomics to identify cell types in the simple three-layered cortex of reptiles, the sister group of mammals, and we are starting new work on an amphibian, the Spanish ribbed newt Pleurodeles waltl. Our quantitative comparison of single-cell transcriptomes across species sheds new light on the evolution of the mammalian six-layered neocortex. The transcriptomic signature of glutamatergic neurons in non-mammals suggests that mammalian neocortical layers are made of new cell types generated by diversification of ancestral gene-regulatory programs. By contrast, we find that the transcriptomes of cortical GABAergic neurons are conserved to an exquisite detail, suggesting that developmental or functional constraints shape the evolution of these cell types. </p>
