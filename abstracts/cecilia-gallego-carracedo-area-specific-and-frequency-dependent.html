        <h1>Area-specific and frequency-dependent relationship between local field potentials and neural population dynamics</h1><h2>Cecilia Gallego Carracedo</h2><h3>Matthew G. Perich, Raeed H. Chowdhury, Lee E. Miller, Juan A. Gallego</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Local field potentials (LFPs) are generated by the summed synaptic input currents to local neurons. Many studies have shown that the activity of populations of cortical neurons is well described by low-dimensional, population-wide “latent dynamics”. Here we provide the first investigation of how much information is shared between these latent dynamics and the LFPs that ostensibly drive them. 

We used microelectrode arrays to record LFPs and single neuron activity from premotor, primary motor and primary somatosensory cortex as monkeys performed an instructed delay reaching task. We calculated the latent dynamics from the single unit activity using principal component analysis. We computed the LFP power in eight standard frequency bands as well as the “local motor potential”, the moving average of the broadband LFP.

We first examined the relationship between each LFP band and the latent dynamics separately for each cortical area using canonical correlation analysis, a method that quantifies the correlation between the dynamics of two sets of signals. Although for all three areas the lowest and highest LFP frequency bands were strongly correlated with the latent dynamics, the LFP-to-latent dynamics correlations at mid-frequencies were quite variable across areas. 

We obtained these results by focusing on one particular aspect of the behaviour: movement preparation for premotor cortex, and movement execution for primary motor and sensory cortices. We asked whether the area-specific relationships were preserved across these different aspects of the behaviour. We computed the canonical correlations between LFP and latent dynamics for both behavioural epochs, then compared the two sets of correlations. Remarkably, for both areas, these correlations were the same during movement planning and execution, and greatly exceeded the correlations observed when monkeys were not engaged in the task. Adopting a neural population view thus allows stable area-specific and frequency-dependent relationships between neural activity and LFPs to be identified. </p>
