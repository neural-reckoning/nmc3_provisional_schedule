        <h1>Body Part- and Location-Selectivity Surrounding hMT in BOLD Responses to Naturalistic Stimuli</h1><h2>Matthew Shinkle</h2><h3>Matthew W. Shinkle, Mark D. Lescroart</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Information about body pose is critical for social communication and human interaction. In this work, we aim to clarify the extent to which potentially multiple regions of lateral occipitotemporal cortex (LOTC) encode information about the locations of body parts. To this end we applied voxel-wise modeling to BOLD responses for five participants across three diverse naturalistic stimulus sets: static natural images, natural movie clips, and computer-rendered scenes. From each stimulus set we used a deep neural network (OpenPose) to extract the locations and identities of different body parts. We then applied regularized linear regression to these features to estimate the relationship between each body feature and the BOLD responses of individual voxels. We validated our regression model by calculating prediction accuracies at each voxel. In addition to FFA, OFA, and pSTS, our model accurately predicted BOLD responses in voxels surrounding hMT, confirming body part selectivity in these regions. Variance partitioning incorporating motion energy features and binary ‘building present’ and ‘human present’ labels revealed unique variance explained by our body model in these regions, suggesting our prediction performance in these voxels is not merely due to naturalistic stimulus confounds. Finally, we contrasted voxel-wise model weights corresponding to different body features to measure differences in tuning based on body part identity and visual field location. This analysis revealed patchy selectivity for hands compared to faces around hMT and selectivity for the contralateral visual field throughout LOTC, particularly near the Lateral Occipital Sulcus. These results argue for an anatomically-circumscribed model of body-selectivity in LOTC and lend support to previous reports positing the existence of multiple sub-regions of EBA.</p>
