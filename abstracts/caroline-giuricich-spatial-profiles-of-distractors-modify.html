        <h1>Spatial profiles of distractors modify saccade trajectories</h1><h2>Caroline Giuricich</h2><h3>Robert Green, York University; Heather Jordan, York University; Mazyar Fallah, York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Previous research has established how temporal factors and object similarity affect saccade trajectories to targets amongst distractors, but only in a specific spatial configuration. To better understand the spatial factors, we varied the egocentric distribution of targets and distractors while their similarity also varied. Participants had to search for the target out of two objects, both located at the same distance from a central fixation cross, with the distractor placed either clockwise or counterclockwise to the target. We measured the curvature of saccades made to the target using five metrics, analyzing the effects of similarity and angular distance. As the results demonstrated that saccades curve towards the distractor for shorter reaction times and away from the distractor for longer reaction times, we split the data accordingly. We find that as angular distance increases, the saccade curvature decreases. As well, for long reaction times only, as the target-distractor similarity decreases, the saccade curvature away from the distractor increases. These results suggest that visual object discrimination drives saccade trajectories but is also modulated by spatial and temporal factors. </p>
