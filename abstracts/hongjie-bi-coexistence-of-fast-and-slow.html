        <h1>Coexistence of fast and slow gamma oscillations in one population of inhibitory spiking neurons</h1><h2>Hongjie  Bi</h2><h3>Hongjie Bi, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, France, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan; Marco Segneri, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, France; Matteo di Volo, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, Information et Complexité, France; Alessandro Torcini, Université de Cergy-Pontoise, France.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Oscillations are a hallmark of neural population activity in various brain regions with a spectrum covering a wide range of frequencies. Within this spectrum γ oscillations have received particular attention due to their ubiquitous nature and their correlation with higher brain functions. Recently, it has been reported that gamma oscillations in the hippocampus of behaving rodents are segregated in two distinct frequency bands: slow and fast. These two gamma rhythms correspond to different states of the network, but their origin has been not yet clarified. Here we show theoretically and numerically that a single inhibitory population can give rise to coexisting slow and fast gamma rhythms corresponding to collective oscillations of a balanced spiking network. The slow and fast gamma rhythms are generated via two different mechanisms: the fast one being driven by the coordinated tonic neural firing and the slow one by endogenous fluctuations due to irregular neural activity. We show that almost instantaneous stimulations can switch the collective gamma oscillations from slow to fast and vice versa. Furthermore, to draw a connection with the experimental observations, we consider the modulation of the gamma rhythms induced by a slower (theta) rhythm driving the network dynamics. In this context, depending on the strength of the forcing and the noise amplitude, we observe phase-amplitude and phase-phase coupling between the fast and slow γ oscillations and the theta forcing. Phase-phase coupling reveals on average different theta-phase preferences for the two coexisting γ rhythms joined to a wide cycle-to-cycle variability.</p>
