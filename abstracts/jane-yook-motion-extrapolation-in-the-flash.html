        <h1>Motion extrapolation in the flash-lag effect depends on perceived, rather than physical speed</h1><h2>Jane Yook</h2><h3>Jane Yook, Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Human Sciences, University of Cologne; Lysha Lee, Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne; Simone Vossel, Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Human Sciences, University of Cologne; Ralph Weidner, Cognitive Neuroscience, Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-3), Forschungszentrum Jülich; Hinze Hogendoorn, Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, The University of Melbourne</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In the flash-lag effect (FLE), a flashed object in spatiotemporal alignment with a moving object is often misperceived as lagging behind the moving object. One proposed explanation for the illusion is based on predictive motion extrapolation and argues that the visual system constantly predicts the position for the moving object in the present moment, in order to compensate for the time required for neural transmission and processing. In this interpretation, the visual system uses an estimate of the object’s velocity to generate a prediction, which implies that the FLE should rely on an explicit neural representation of velocity. By contrast, alternative explanations of the FLE based on differential latencies or temporal averaging should not be dependent on such a representation of velocity. Here, we test the extrapolation hypothesis by investigating the effect of illusory changes in perceived speed on the magnitude of the FLE in two experiments. In Experiment 1, we manipulated perceived speed by adding temporal noise to a rotating wedge stimulus, and in Experiment 2 we manipulated perceived speed by changing the luminance contrast of the wedge. We show for both manipulations, differences in perceived speed corresponded to differences in FLE magnitude: both perceived speed and perceived flash-lag increased when the wedge contained dynamic noise relative to static noise, and when it was presented in low relative to high contrast. Moreover, this effect was consistent across two different textures. Our findings therefore indicate that the FLE depends on an explicit neural representation of velocity, consistent with the motion extrapolation hypothesis.</p>
