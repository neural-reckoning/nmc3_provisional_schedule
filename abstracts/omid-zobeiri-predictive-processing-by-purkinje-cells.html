        <h1>Predictive processing by Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis during active versus passive self-motion</h1><h2>Omid Zobeiri</h2><h3>Kathleen Cullen</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The ability to distinguish between self-generated (reafference) vs. externally-applied
(exafference) sensory signals is fundamental for ensuring accurate motor control. This is
particularly evident in the context of the vestibular system, in which the same neurons that
receive afferent input also mediate vestibulo-spinal reflexes (VSR). Notably, while VSRs are
essential for postural stability, they can be counterproductive during active motion. Previous
studies by our group have shown that VSR neurons selectively code passive head movements.
Although, the cerebellum is hypothesized to play a role in vestibular reafference suppression,
the exact underlying neural mechanism is unknown. Accordingly, here we recorded from
Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis of the vestibular cerebellum in rhesus monkeys during
passive and active motion. We first recorded neuronal responses to vestibular-only and neck
proprioceptive-only passive stimulation. Simple spike activity encoded both stimuli in a direction-
dependent manner. We then passively applied both vestibular and proprioceptive stimuli
simultaneously (i.e., passive head-on-body rotations) and found that Purkinje cells linearly
integrated these two inputs. However, comparison of neuronal responses to active and passive
head-on-body motion revealed a marked response attenuation for active head motion (~70%,
p<0.01). Accordingly, we next tested whether motor inputs to the Purkinje cells might mediate
the suppression observed during active movements. Most cells receive and encode motor
signals, yet a linear model could not explain response attenuation during active movements.
Finally, we compared the climbing fiber inputs to the Purkinje cells for passive vs. active head
movements and found that the probability of a complex spike firing increased (~60%, p<0.01)
immediately following (~20ms) the onset of passive but not active head movements, suggesting
that complex spikes detect externally-applied versus self-generated vestibular inputs. Taken
together, these results provide new insights into the cerebellar computations performed to
suppress the sensory consequences of self-generated movement to ensure postural stability.</p>
