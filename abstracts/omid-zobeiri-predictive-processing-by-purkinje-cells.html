        <h1>Predictive processing by Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis during active versus passive self-motion</h1><h2>Omid Zobeiri</h2><h3>Kathleen Cullen</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The ability to distinguish between self-generated (reafference) vs. externally-applied<br/>(exafference) sensory signals is fundamental for ensuring accurate motor control. This is<br/>particularly evident in the context of the vestibular system, in which the same neurons that<br/>receive afferent input also mediate vestibulo-spinal reflexes (VSR). Notably, while VSRs are<br/>essential for postural stability, they can be counterproductive during active motion. Previous<br/>studies by our group have shown that VSR neurons selectively code passive head movements.<br/>Although, the cerebellum is hypothesized to play a role in vestibular reafference suppression,<br/>the exact underlying neural mechanism is unknown. Accordingly, here we recorded from<br/>Purkinje cells in the anterior vermis of the vestibular cerebellum in rhesus monkeys during<br/>passive and active motion. We first recorded neuronal responses to vestibular-only and neck<br/>proprioceptive-only passive stimulation. Simple spike activity encoded both stimuli in a direction-<br/>dependent manner. We then passively applied both vestibular and proprioceptive stimuli<br/>simultaneously (i.e., passive head-on-body rotations) and found that Purkinje cells linearly<br/>integrated these two inputs. However, comparison of neuronal responses to active and passive<br/>head-on-body motion revealed a marked response attenuation for active head motion (~70%,<br/>p<0.01). Accordingly, we next tested whether motor inputs to the Purkinje cells might mediate<br/>the suppression observed during active movements. Most cells receive and encode motor<br/>signals, yet a linear model could not explain response attenuation during active movements.<br/>Finally, we compared the climbing fiber inputs to the Purkinje cells for passive vs. active head<br/>movements and found that the probability of a complex spike firing increased (~60%, p<0.01)<br/>immediately following (~20ms) the onset of passive but not active head movements, suggesting<br/>that complex spikes detect externally-applied versus self-generated vestibular inputs. Taken<br/>together, these results provide new insights into the cerebellar computations performed to<br/>suppress the sensory consequences of self-generated movement to ensure postural stability.</p>
