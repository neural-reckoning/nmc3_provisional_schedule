        <h1>Prefrontal and Parietal Neuronal Activity Mediates Working Memory Judgments</h1><h2>Sihai Li</h2><h3>Sihai Li, Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine; Christos Constantinidis, Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine; and Xue-Lian Qi, Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex plays a critical role in spatial working memory and its activity predicts behavioral responses in delayed response tasks. Here we addressed if this predictive ability extends to other working memory tasks, and if it is present in other brain areas. We trained monkeys to remember the location of a stimulus and determine whether a second stimulus appeared at the same location or not. Neurophysiological recordings were performed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. We hypothesized that random drifts causing the peak activity of the network to move away from the first stimulus location and towards the location of the second stimulus would result in categorical errors. Indeed, for both areas, in non-matching trials, when the first stimulus appeared in a neuronâ€™s preferred location, the neuron showed significantly higher firing rates in correct than in error trials, and vice versa, when the first stimulus appeared at a non-preferred location, activity in error trials was higher than in correct. The results indicate that the activity of both dlPFC and PPC neurons is predictive of categorical judgments of information maintained in working memory, and neuronal firing rate deviations are revealing of the contents of working memory.</p>
