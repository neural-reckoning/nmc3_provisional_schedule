        <h1>Central neural circuits supporting olfactory navigation in walking Drosophila</h1><h2>Andrew  Matheson (He/Him/His)</h2><h3>Andrew MM Matheson, Neuroscience Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center; Timothy A Currier, Neuroscience Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center; Aaron J Lanz, Neuroscience Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center; Angela M Licata, Neuroscience Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center, Katherine I Nagel, Neuroscience Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>All organisms must navigate to find food and resources. For many organisms this requires navigating in a turbulent chemical environment, where odour cues alone are insufficient to locate food sources. A commonly used algorithm in such environments is to surge upwind during odour, and cast crosswind at odour offset. Critically, this algorithm depends on the integration of odour information with wind direction cues. Previously, our lab developed a high-throughput behavioural paradigm for walking Drosophila, where an attractive odour elicits two motor programs: an upwind run during odour, and search behaviour at odour offset. Here, we used this paradigm to identify central circuits that translate sensory stimuli into navigation behaviours.

To identify neurons involved in olfactory motor program generation, we took an optogenetic approach. Beginning at the olfactory periphery, we first showed that activation of orco+ olfactory receptor neurons produces both upwind runs and offset search. We next activated output neurons in higher order olfactory areas, the lateral horn and mushroom body (LHONs and MBONs), and found subsets of these also produce the complete olfactory navigation motor program of upwind runs and offset search. Using 2-photon imaging and a 5 direction wind-odour manifold, we found these LHONs and MBONs encode odour in a non-directional manner, indicating that odour and wind direction signals must be integrated downstream.

To identify downstream targets of navigation-promoting LHONs and MBONs, we used trans-synaptic tracing. We found that downstream neurons targeted the fan-shaped body (FSB), a region implicated in navigation. We performed an activation screen of the FSB and identified both input neurons and local/output neurons that generate upwind navigation when activated. Several groups of input neurons responded to odour in a non-directional manner, while at least one group of local neurons showed some direction-selective odour responses.  Connectomic analysis suggests these local neuron receive input both from olfactory FSB inputs and from wind-direction selective ventral P-FNs (Currier et al. 2020). Local FSB neurons may represent a site where appetitive odour and wind direction information are integrated to drive navigation behaviours. This work will make possible a mechanistic understanding of the circuit basis of olfactory navigation.</p>
