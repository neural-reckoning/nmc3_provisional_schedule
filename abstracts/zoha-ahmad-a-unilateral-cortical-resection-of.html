        <h1>A Unilateral Cortical Resection of Both Visual Pathways Alters Action but not Perception</h1><h2>Zoha Ahmad</h2><h3>Zoha Ahmad, York University; Marlene Behrmann, Carnegie Mellon University; Christina Patterson, University of Pittsburgh; Erez Freud, York University </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Cortical resection, a treatment for humans with pharmaco-resistant epilepsy, provides a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of the nature and extent of cortical (re)organization. Previous studies have found that pediatric patients with resections of the ventral visual pathway still retain normal visuoperceptual abilities. It is not clear whether visuomotor computations, carried out by the dorsal pathway, follow a similar behavioral pattern. To address this outstanding issue, we examined visuomotor and visuoperceptual behaviors in a pediatric patient TC, who has a cortical resection that includes portions of the left ventral and dorsal pathways.  TC used her right and left hands to estimate perceptually the width of blocks that varied in width and length (but not in overall size), and, in a separate condition, to grasp the same objects across their width. Consistent with previous studies, TCâ€™s perceptual performance was comparable to that of controls.  In contrast, TC was markedly impaired in her visuomotor sensitivity to object shape but only when she grasped the objects with her contralesional right (and not ipsilesional left) hand. These results provide novel evidence for a striking difference in the reorganization profiles of the two visual pathways. This difference might be attributed to a greater degree of hemispheric specialization of the dorsal pathway, or, alternatively, to differential maturation rates of the two pathways, such that the dorsal pathway maturation precedes that of the ventral pathway.</p>
