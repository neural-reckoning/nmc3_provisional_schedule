        <h1>A New Computational Theory of Intelligence</h1><h2>Aman Patel (he/him)</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>There is a large corpus of literature seeking to define “intelligence,” but many of these definitions focus on describing key features of intelligent systems, instead of the mechanisms that give rise to it. However, intelligence is such a nebulous concept that it might be best defined by how it works, rather than what it entails. In this paper, I synthesize insights from neuroscience, human development, and computer science to present a new mechanistic formulation of “intelligence”—as well as a new strategy for engineering it. The key hypothesis of this view is that all cognitive processes, including sensing, planning, logic, memory, and even consciousness, can be represented as information processing under a massively-parallel network of probabilistic circuits that model unknown processes. Each of these model-building circuits uses its input information, along with certain preset parameters, to attempt to produce the same output that the unknown process does. A complex network of such circuits may exhibit behavior that approaches what we typically consider to be “intelligent.”</p>
