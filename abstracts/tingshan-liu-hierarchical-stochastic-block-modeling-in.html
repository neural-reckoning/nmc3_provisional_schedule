        <h1>Hierarchical stochastic block modeling in the Drosophila connectome</h1><h2>Tingshan Liu</h2><h3>Tingshan Liu, Johns Hopkins University; Benjamin D. Pedigo, Johns Hopkins University; Thomas L. Athey, Johns Hopkins University; Joshua T. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A connectome describes functional interactions or structural connections between regions of interest in the brain. The Drosophila connectome has been studied extensively in the literature and modeled as a complex network to understand the relationship between brain functionality and animal behavior. Similar to human connectomes, Drosophila connectomes also exhibit modular structure despite their relatively small sizes where cluster-like regions in the brain can be further divided into subclusters based on functional or structural similarity. Built upon an automatic Gaussian mixture modeling technique, we introduce a hierarchical stochastic blockmodel clustering algorithm which recursively clusters a network to obtain sub-clusters that can be approximated as stochastic blockmodels. We demonstrate the hierarchical structure of the mushroom body of Drosophila connectomes revealed by the proposed algorithm.
