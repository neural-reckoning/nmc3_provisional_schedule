        <h1>Are primates just big frogs? Forelimb force direction and amplitude are independently controlled by spinal motor modules</h1><h2>Amit Yaron (He\Him)</h2><h3>Amit yaron NCNP; David Paul Kowalski, NCNP\Drexel ; Hiroaki Yaguchi, NCNP ; Tomohiko Takei, NCNP\Kyoto University;  Kazuhiko Seki, NCNP</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Modular organization of the spinal motor system is thought to reduce the cognitive complexity of<br/>simultaneously controlling the large number of muscles and joints in the human body. Although modular<br/>organization has been confirmed in the hindlimb control system of several animal species, it has yet to be<br/>established in the forelimb motor system or in primates. Expanding upon experiments originally<br/>performed in the frog lumbar spinal cord, we examined whether co-stimulation of two sites in the<br/>macaque monkey cervical spinal cord results in motor activity that is a simple linear sum of the responses<br/>evoked by stimulating each site individually. Similar to previous observations in the frog and rodent<br/>hindlimb, our analysis revealed that in most cases (77% of all pairs), the directions of the force fields<br/>elicited by co-stimulation were highly similar to those predicted by the simple linear sum of those elicited<br/>by stimulating each site individually. A comparable simple summation of EMG output, especially in the<br/>proximal muscles, suggested that this linear summation of force field direction was produced by a spinal<br/>neural mechanism whereby the forelimb motor output recruited by co-stimulation was also summed<br/>linearly. We further found that the force field magnitudes exhibited supra-linear (amplified) summation,<br/>which was also observed in the EMG output of distal forelimb muscles, implying a novel feature of<br/>primate forelimb control. Overall, our observations support the idea that complex movements in the<br/>primate forelimb control system are made possible by flexibly combined spinal motor modules.</p>
