        <h1>Are primates just big frogs? Forelimb force direction and amplitude are independently controlled by spinal motor modules</h1><h2>Amit Yaron (He\Him)</h2><h3>Amit yaron NCNP; David Paul Kowalski, NCNP\Drexel ; Hiroaki Yaguchi, NCNP ; Tomohiko Takei, NCNP\Kyoto University;  Kazuhiko Seki, NCNP</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Modular organization of the spinal motor system is thought to reduce the cognitive complexity of
simultaneously controlling the large number of muscles and joints in the human body. Although modular
organization has been confirmed in the hindlimb control system of several animal species, it has yet to be
established in the forelimb motor system or in primates. Expanding upon experiments originally
performed in the frog lumbar spinal cord, we examined whether co-stimulation of two sites in the
macaque monkey cervical spinal cord results in motor activity that is a simple linear sum of the responses
evoked by stimulating each site individually. Similar to previous observations in the frog and rodent
hindlimb, our analysis revealed that in most cases (77% of all pairs), the directions of the force fields
elicited by co-stimulation were highly similar to those predicted by the simple linear sum of those elicited
by stimulating each site individually. A comparable simple summation of EMG output, especially in the
proximal muscles, suggested that this linear summation of force field direction was produced by a spinal
neural mechanism whereby the forelimb motor output recruited by co-stimulation was also summed
linearly. We further found that the force field magnitudes exhibited supra-linear (amplified) summation,
which was also observed in the EMG output of distal forelimb muscles, implying a novel feature of
primate forelimb control. Overall, our observations support the idea that complex movements in the
primate forelimb control system are made possible by flexibly combined spinal motor modules.</p>
