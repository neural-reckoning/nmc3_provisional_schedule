        <h1>Spiking Time-Dependent Plasticity implements self-organized resonances</h1><h2>Pau Vilimelis Aceituno</h2><h3>Pau Vilimelis Aceituno, ETH ZÃ¼rich</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neural populations exposed to a certain stimulus learn to represent it better. However, the process that leads local, self-organized rules to do so is unclear. We address the question of how can a neural periodic input be learned and use the Differential Hebbian Learning framework, coupled with a homeostatic mechanism to derive two self-consistency equations that lead to increased responses to the same stimulus. Although all our simulations are done with simple Leaky-Integrate and Fire neurons and standard Spiking Time Dependent Plasticity learning rules,
our results can be easily interpreted in terms of rates and population codes.
This talk is mostly theoretical, but during the interactive part I would like to discuss biological predictions and neurorobotic implementations.
