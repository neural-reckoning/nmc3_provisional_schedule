        <h1>Using topological data analysis to investigate the relationship between population gut microbiome and Parkinson's Disease</h1><h2>Eva Lymberopoulos (she/her/hers)</h2><h3>Nikhil Sharma, UCL Institute of Neurology </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neurological disorders are the leading global cause of disability, and Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the fastest growing of them. Thus, finding disease-modifying treatments for this debilitating disorder is becoming ever more pressing. Increasing evidence from animal and human studies points to a central role of gut dysbiosis in contributing to PD pathology, a potential target for novel therapies. However, standard analyses cannot consider the complexity and non-linearity of the gut microbiome, likely missing many subtle relationships. This study is the first to use indirect association with PD on a population gut microbiome dataset, and additionally the first to use Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to analyse an association of the microbiome with disease. For this, countries in a large, open-access microbiome dataset (sample size N=1151) were grouped based on Years Lived with Disease (YLD). The study used TDA to analyse the network structure of the microbiome data and associate it with these disease groups (High or Low YLDs) and other host factors through network enrichment stratification. We found that the PD groups were associated with distinct clusters of the microbiome network, a pattern that covaried with certain phyla. Specifically, the High YLD group was associated with Bacteroidetes, while the Low YLD group was associated with Firmicutes, but also Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. The latter two are hypothesised to relate to a lower burden of PD through their complex inverse relationship with Firmicutes, which are thought to be neuroprotective. Thus, TDA is a fruitful tool for microbiome analysis and has extended previous findings. Importantly, the study supports the microbiome as a promising candidate target for scalable novel intervention therapies, such as pre-, pro-, or antibiotics, among others. In the future, we aim to replicate these findings in other large datasets and combine the novel methodology with machine learning.</p>
