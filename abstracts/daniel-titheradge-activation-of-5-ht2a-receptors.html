Here, we quantify the effects of a selective 5-HT2a agonist 25I-NBOH (25I) on functional connectivity in the cortico-limbic system of behaving rats.  
5 adult male Wistar rats were implanted with local field potential recording electrodes in basolateral amygdala (BLA), dorsal hippocampus (dCA1), infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PrL) cortex.  Baseline recordings in a familiar open field were followed by intraperitoneal injection of 25I (2mg/kg) or vehicle.  LFP power, coherence and pairwise spectral multivariate granger causality (GC) were analysed for pre-injection, early post-injection (5-10 minutes) and late post-injection (35-40 minutes) periods. 
25I reduced movement and increased the proportion of time spent at the open field perimeter.  25I induced reductions in broadband spectral power across all four regions, but increases in high-gamma (65-80Hz) in the BLA and HFO in BLA, IL and PRL.  HFO peaks were most pronounced in IL.  High-gamma and HFO coherence between IL, PRL and BLA increased; coherence between CA1 and other regions showed only a slight increase in the HFO range. 
25I caused a marked increase in high-gamma GC from IL to BLA relative to pre-injection or vehicle, and a marked increase in HFO GC from IL to PRL.  In the early post injection period, there was an increase in HFO GC from dCA1 to BLA.
Our data evidence a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated increase in functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and amygdala with an increase in “top down” control of the amygdala by the IL. These changes may contribute to the network basis of antidepressant effects of psychedelic drugs including psilocybin and ketamine. </p>
