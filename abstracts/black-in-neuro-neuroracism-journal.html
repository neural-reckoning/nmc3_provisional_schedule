        <h1>Black In Neuro: Neuroracism Journal Club</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Black In Neuro will lead a journal club as the second installment of a 2-part event on neuroracism.

Thirty years ago, an international scientific project (the Human Genome project) set the goal to identify, map, and understand all of human DNA and genes. Since this project’s completion in 2003, there has been an increase of interest in precision medicine or treatment plans personalized for an individual based on their genetic make up, environment, and lifestyle. However, the human reference genome generated from the human genome project was primarily assembled from European ancestry and had a stark underrepresentation of African ancestry. In this journal club, we will meet with the authors of the 2020 CellPress Report, Missing in Action: African Ancestry in Brain Research. We will learn how underrepresentation of African ancestry in research is related to health disparities in diagnosis and treatment and discuss future steps to create inclusive science and medicine.
