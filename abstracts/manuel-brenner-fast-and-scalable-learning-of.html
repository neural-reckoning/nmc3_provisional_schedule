        <h1>Fast and scalable learning of generative models for chaotic dynamical systems and neural data</h1><h2>Manuel Brenner</h2><h3>Bereska, Leonard; Kuo, Frederic; Durstewitz, Daniel</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Dynamical systems theory is a powerful framework for understanding the brain's computation. 
However, neural systems tend to be intrinsically noisy and near the edge of chaos, making them challenging to capture with non-divergent, i.e., globally stable models.
With some arguing that mental illnesses may be fundamentally understood as disorders of neural dynamics, it remains crucial to learn models from neural data that capture the underlying dynamics and are interpretable and amenable to dynamical systems analysis tools.
As a remedy, we introduce a piece-wise linear recurrent neural network model that is by design stable and is trained by a simple, fast and scalable variational inference algorithm.
We show how we can significantly improve inference by introducing basis expansion in the latent state equation, and demonstrate that this strongly improves the system estimation on local metrics based on prediction and global measures based on state-space geometry. We measure our framework's performance on synthetic data from the Lorenz attractor and the Lorenz-96 system, and show preliminary results from experimental data from EEG and MSU recordings.</p>
