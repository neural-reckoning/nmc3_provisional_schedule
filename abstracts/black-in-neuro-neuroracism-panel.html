        <h1>Black In Neuro: Neuroracism Panel Discussion</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Black In Neuro will lead a panel discussion as the first installment of a 2-part event on neuroracism.

The NeuroRacism panel will center discussions on how we in academia collect, use and interpret data about Black people. Panelists will highlight ongoing biases and anti-Black racism that is currently embedded in the practices of neuro-related research. We will explore what it means to think about data critically, from a social justice oriented lens, and to question the current status quo.

Participants are encouraged to revisit Black in Neuroâ€™s NeuroRacism panel from this summer to gain further context and perspectives. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inYtc5apSuk&t=1458s

Moderator: De-Shaine Murray

Panelist: 
- Kafui Dzirasa, PhD

- Abeba Birhane, PhD Candidate

- Shalini Kantayya</p>
