        <h1>pyAFQ: Automated Fiber Quantification, in Python</h1><h2>John Kruper</h2><h3>Ariel Rokem, University of Washington Department of Psychology</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The white matter contains the long-range connections that form brain networks. Diffusion weighted MRI (dMRI) is an in vivo, non-invasive measurement that characterizes brain tissue and indicates  the trajectory of these connections. This data can be used to detect, characterize, and monitor brain diseases. Additionally, brain connections  change during learning and could help account for individual differences in cognition. To perform this analysis at scale, methods for delineation of the major tracts are needed. Automated Fiber Quantification in Python (pyAFQ; https://github.com/yeatmanlab/pyAFQ) is a python package that automates this process. Given dMRI data that has undergone standard preprocessing, pyAFQ will automatically perform computational tractography, delineate and segment the major tracts based on individual-level anatomical constraints, and extract the diffusion measurements along those tracks (e.g., fractional anisotropy  and mean diffusivity). We call this entire process tractometry.

To demonstrate the use of these methods, we compared tract profiles generated by pyAFQ to the original, matlab-based AFQ software. They are in close agreement and have similar test-retest intersubject reliability. We ran pyAFQ on test-retest data from the human connectome project (HCP) and compared different tractography and segmentation models and methods in  this  dataset. For comparison, we ran pyAFQ on clinical-grade data.</p>
