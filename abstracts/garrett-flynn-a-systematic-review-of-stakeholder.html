        <h1>A systematic review of stakeholder perspectives on cognitive effects of brain stimulation</h1><h2>Garrett Flynn</h2><h3>Miranda Zhang, Flintridge Preparatory School, La Cañada Flintridge, CA, USA; Kevin Rao, La Salle High School, Pasadena, CA, USA; Eran Klein, Center for Neurotechnology and Department of Philosophy, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, Department of Neurology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR; Dong Song, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Whether implemented in deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) systems, or bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), targeted electrical stimulation of the brain is an emerging technology for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Despite the promise of neurostimulation, there is an accumulating body of literature on side effects, mostly on motor, psychiatric or psychosocial effects. Cognitive side effects of neurostimulation have been relatively understudied and underreported by patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers (Mehanna, Bajwa, Fernandez, & Shukla, 2017). Several neuroethics scholars have advocated for complementing clinical measures with qualitative methods that characterize complex, context-specific changes in language, memory, and other cognitive processes following brain stimulation (Shook, Galvagni, & Giordano, 2014). Additionally, there is increasing scientific and medical interest in the use of brain stimulation techniques to treat disorders of cognition, such as dementia (Hampson et al., 2018). Reviews of brain-computer interface (BCI) studies using social research methods have proven useful to guide future qualitative research (Kögel, Jox, & Friedrich, 2020; Kögel, Schmid, Jox, & Friedrich, 2019). However, qualitative brain stimulation studies where neural activity is directly modulated to affect cognition have not been the focus of these reviews. <br/>We conducted a systematic review of literature on stakeholder perspectives on cognitive effects of neurostimulation. A PubMed database search of qualitative studies on brain stimulation yielded 34 unique datasets from 41 publications that include quoted responses to open-ended interview or survey questions. Of these 34 datasets, 14 (41%) had at least one associated publication addressing actual or expected cognitive effects. Patient-reported cognitive effects were logged in 7 (50%) of the 14 datasets, yet only one (14%) of these seven datasets indicated that patients were asked about cognitive effects. On the other hand, 5 (36%) of the 14 datasets logged provider-reported cognitive effects and four (80%) out of these 5 datasets asked providers about expectations or views of cognitive enhancement. Similarly, quoted providers mention that brain stimulation worsens, restores, and enhances cognition with equal frequency while patients describe that brain stimulation actually worsens cognition slightly more than it restores. Our findings suggest that previous qualitative studies on brain stimulation lack focused attention to cognitive changes—specifically patient-reported cognitive impairment. As such, future studies of neurostimulation should aim to more consistently and rigorously evaluate cognitive effects. Researchers and clinicians involved in existing studies may also benefit from development of qualitative tools that assess cognitive effects on device users.</p>
