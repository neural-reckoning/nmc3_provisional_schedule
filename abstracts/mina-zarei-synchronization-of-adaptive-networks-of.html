        <h1>Synchronization of adaptive networks of Sakaguchi-Kuramoto oscillators</h1><h2>Mina Zarei</h2><h3>Erfan Deris, Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences; Mina Zarei, Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences; Nahid Azimi, Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model is a generalization of the well-known Kuramoto model including a phase-lag or frustration parameter. In this work we study the structure and synchronization dynamics of adaptive networks of  Sakaguchi-Kuramoto oscillators based on Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules. We show that following anti-Hebbian learning the structure of network is gradually evolved such that the global synchronization is enhanced. On the other hand,  Hebbian learning  leads to the local synchronization and clustering structure of the network. Moreover, in the presence of frustration the connectivity patterns of the oscillators changes asymmetrically with respect to the mean frequency of the oscillators. In other words, the connectivity patterns of the oscillators with high and low natural frequencies would be different in the evolved networks. Previous studies have also shown that oscillators on the human connectome  follow a hierarchy of timescales, i.e.  highly connected regions have low natural frequencies and peripheral regions have high natural frequencies. In addition, we found that the value of the frustration parameter affects the size and the number of the clusters in the networks that are evolved based on the Hebbian learning rule.
