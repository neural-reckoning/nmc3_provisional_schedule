        <h1>The left temporoparietal junction causally supports goal emulation in observational learning</h1><h2>Lei Zhang (he/him)</h2><h3>Lei Zhang, University of Vienna; Farid I. Kandil, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Claus C. Hilgetag, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Jan Gläscher, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Humans learn from their own trial-and-error experience and observing others by inferring their goals. Previous studies have established a comprehensive neurocomputational account of the integration between directly earning and observational learning. Crucially, these studies have identified that bilateral temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is functionally associated with goal emulation. However, the causal role of bilateral TPJ in such processes remains unclear. Here, employing continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over bilateral TPJ as well as vertex, we tested how the TPJ supports goal emulation in a probabilistic reversal learning task (N = 31). Participants on each trial were first required to choose between two stimuli, after they have seen the choices from four other co-players, they had the opportunity to adjust their choices. A probabilistic reward was then delivered given their second choice. Notably, participants were instructed that they would play this game with four “intelligent computers,” and choices from those computers were in fact generated from our computational algorithm model (reported elsewhere), such that they matched with actual human behavior. To increase ecological validity, we used human faces to indicate each computer. Behavioral results indicate that disrupting activity in the left TPJ resulted in reduced choice switch probability and longer response time when confronted with opposing social information, as opposed to the right TPJ and vertex conditions. In addition, choice accuracy was declined when participants actually switched their choices in the left TPJ condition. No significant difference was observed between trials across stimulation sites. Computational modeling with the hierarchical Bayesian approach suggests that the corresponding parameter quantifying social information significantly decreased in the left TPJ condition, as compared to the right TPJ and vertex conditions. Together, our results provide evidence for the causal role of left TPJ in supporting goal emulation in human observational learning.</p>
