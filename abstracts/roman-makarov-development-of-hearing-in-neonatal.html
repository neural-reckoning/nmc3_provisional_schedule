        <h1>Development of Hearing in Neonatal Rats:  Cortical Responses to Air- and Bone-Conducted Sound.</h1><h2>Roman Makarov</h2><h3>Mikhail Sintsov, Laboratory of Neurobiology Kazan Federal University Kazan Russia; Guzel Valeeva, Laboratory of Neurobiology Kazan Federal University Kazan Russia; Pavel Starikov, MIPT The School of Electronics Photonics and Molecular Physics Moscow Russia; Dmitriy Negrov, MIPT The School of Electronics Photonics and Molecular Physics Moscow Russia; Roustem Khazipov, Laboratory of Neurobiology Kazan Federal University Kazan Russia and INMED INSERM UMR1249 Aix-Marseille University Marseille France;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In rats, sensitivity to environmental sounds emerges at around P11-13. However, morphological studies suggest that for a few days before that, the hearing function is constrained mainly by the immaturity of structures responsible for sound conduction. In accordance with that, it was shown that the bone-conducted (BC) sounds, which bypass the immature outer and middle ear, can evoke auditory brainstem responses already from P7. Whether these early responses reach the auditory cortex, and what are their spatio-temporal features remain largely unknown. Using epidural uECoG arrays and intracortical silicone probes, we showed that, starting from P8, responses evoked by the BC-sound involve thalamus-mediated activation of the auditory cortex. The evoked potentials had the initial positive and the following negative peaks, the latencies and amplitudes of which significantly changed with age. These responses largely overlapped with the responses evoked by electrical stimulation of the cochlea and the inferior colliculus as well as with the responses to normal intensity air-conducted sound (70 dB) after the onset of hearing (>P13). Topographic mapping revealed that BC-evoked responses co-localize with high-frequency sound representations in the auditory cortex. In addition, we showed that BC-evoked responses can be eliminated by bilateral cochlear ablation. We also found that similar cortical responses to the airborne stimuli of high intensity (>100 dB) can be evoked starting from P8, suggesting that the onset of sensory function highly depends on the sound conduction. Our main finding is that the earliest responses evoked by BC and high-intensity airborne stimuli reach the auditory cortex and undergo significant improvement over the second postnatal week. We suggest that this stimulus-evoked activity can potentially cooperate with spontaneous activity in the formation of auditory circuits during the pre-hearing period. Besides that, our study reveals remarkable similarities in the major developmental milestones of the auditory and visual systems. </p>
