        <h1>Inferring causal transmission probability from pairwise recordings and optogenetics</h1><h2>Mikkel Elle Lepper√∏d</h2><h3>Marianne Fyhn; Torkel Hafting; Tristan Stoeber; Konrad Kording</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>To study how the brain works, it is crucial to identify causal interactions between neurons, which is thought to require perturbations. 
However, when using optogenetics, we typically perturb multiple neurons, producing a confound - any of the stimulated neurons can have affected the postsynaptic neuron. 
In this study we show how this produces large biases, and how they can be reduced using the instrumental variable (IV) technique from econometrics. 
The interaction between stimulation and the absolute refractory period produces a weak, approximately random signal which can be exploited to estimate causal transmission probability. 
When simulating integrate-and-fire neurons, we find that estimates from IV are better than na\"ive techniques. 
Presented is a robust analysis framework for mapping out network connectivity based on causal neuron interactions. </p>
