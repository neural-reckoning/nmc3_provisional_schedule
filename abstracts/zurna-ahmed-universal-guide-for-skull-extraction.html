        <h1>Universal guide for skull extraction and design of custom-fitted implants for continuous and discontinuous skulls</h1><h2>Zurna Ahmed</h2><h3>Naubahar Agha; Attila Trunk; Michael Berger; Alexander Gail</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Intracranial neurophysiological recordings require chronic implants to provide access to the brain through the cranium. Such implants are mounted to the skull and commonly build from hard, durable materials. Especially in larger animals, which participate in experiments over extended periods of time, implants should match the skull curvature to promote osseointegration and avoid tissue and bacterial ingress over time. <br/><br/>Proposed CAD methods for designing implants to date have focused on naïve animals with continuous and even skull surfaces and calculate Boolean differences between implant and skull surface to fit the implant to the skull curvature. However, custom-fitting by calculating the difference fails if a discontinuous skull surface needs to be matched. Also, the difference method does not allow designs which require constant material thickness along the curvature after fitting.<br/><br/>We present a universal guide for custom-fitted design of skull implants and production. Its major advancement is its suitability to unusual skull conditions, such as discontinuities or irregularities on the skull surface. It furthermore provides a description of virtual implant bending to match the skull curvature while maintaining implant thickness, e.g. for using fixed screw lengths. The guide makes use of only a few software tools and the final virtual product can be manufactured using CNC milling or 3D printing. <br/>We demonstrate the process for a wide spectrum of scenarios ranging from complex-shaped single-pieced implants to detailed multi-component implant systems– built on even or discontinuous skull and report the experience over several years in four rhesus monkeys.<br/>A detailed description of this process suitable for non-expert users will be available on GitHub including step-by-step video instructions.<br/></p>
