Using optogenetics, it is possible to express light-activated membrane proteins (opsins) in survived retinal neurons to create artificial photoreceptors. A promising approach is to model center-surround antagonism in retinal neurons to partly restore visual information processing. In our study we used pyramidal neurons of mice and rats as a model system to model center-surround antagonism for possible use in the treatment of retinal degeneration.<br/>  <br/>We created a genetic construct carrying the genes of excitatory (CHR2) and inhibitory (GtACR2) light-activated proteins. A mutant IRES sequence was inserted between two genes to ensure an accurate two-gene expression ratio in each cell and to reduce the expression of the inhibitory opsin gene. In addition, excitatory opsin was targeted to the somatic region of cells using the Kv2.1 motif. We conducted transfection of mouse cortical neurons and primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons with this genetic construct. Electrical activity of transfected neurons in primary cultures and brain slices was recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp. Blue light stimulation was applied to the central or peripheral area of a neuron. <br/><br/>It was shown that light stimulation of the central area of the transfected neuron leads to cell activation. In contrast, light stimulation of the peripheral area of the neuron causes suppression of neuronal activity.<br/><br/>In our study, the center-surround antagonism was successfully modeled in neurons. The genetic construct containing genes of two light-activated proteins could have potential application in the therapy of retinal degeneration by delivery to retinal neurons using viral vectors.<br/></p>
