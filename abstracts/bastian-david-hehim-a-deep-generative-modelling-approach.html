Automated approaches have been proven useful for the detection of FCDs and their use may enhance the postoperative outcome. However, as even most elaborate approaches do not yield satisfactory sensitivity, the development of novel approaches is warranted on clinical grounds. MRI features of FCD type IIb include cortical T2-signal hyperintensities but have sparse correlates in T1-weighted MR-volumes. We here describe an approach leveraging on this apparent difference in MR-modalities and the power of conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) in modality synthesis, by creating a difference image between the real FLAIR and a T1-based synthetic FLAIR mimicking healthy brain structures. We show that the integration of this information in a convolutional neural network (CNN) supports the automatized detection of FCDs.

Methods: We retrospectively collected and manually labelled T1w and FLAIR images of 42 patients (18 females; age=38.8±11.4 y) with an FCD type IIb. T1w images served as input for our cGAN, pre-trained on 80 datasets of healthy controls (37 females; age=44.8±10.6 y), to synthesize artificial FLAIR images. Real and synthetic FLAIR images were in turn subtracted. T1w, FLAIR and the difference images were passed to a multi-scale 3D CNN. Specificity was assessed on a separate cohort of 56 mesial temporal lobe epilepsy patients (35 females; age=39.2±11.5).

Results: The cGAN showed robust generation of synthetic FLAIR images on non-lesional brains (SSIM±σ = 0.92±0.04). Employing a five-fold cross-validation scheme, our CNN-classifier reached a sensitivity of 92.9% (39/42 FCDs detected), while maintaining a high specificity of 96.4% (54/56 true negatives).

Conclusion: Our combined deep learning approach using a cGAN for modality synthesis followed by a CNN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, it is conceivable that our approach may generalize to any other pathology imaged with complementary imaging modalities.</p>
