        <h1>Collective response of oscillating neuronal population to the applied perturbation: a computational framework </h1><h2>Faeze Aminmansoor</h2><h3>Alireza Valizadeh, Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS)</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Brain oscillations are hypothesized to modulate the inter-cortical communication and control the integration of information. The signal exchange in such processes relies on the response of the networks to the incoming inputs. Characterizing the network’s response with respect to the timing of input’s arrival, though, is crucial to assess the mechanism of cortical communication. In this study, we introduce a computational framework to investigate the collective response of a network regarding the perturbation phase at which it is received.<br/><br/><br/>The role of inhibitory interneurons in generation of brain oscillations has firmly been established. Accordingly, we used a network of 500 inhibitory Integrate and Fire (IF) neurons and applied a brief perturbation to 10% of population at different phases of the LFP oscillation. The transient changes in the cycle period of subsequent oscillations as well as the change in their amplitudes are documented as a function of the perturbation phase. The resulted characteristic curve is called collective Phase (Amplitude) Response Curves (cPRC & cARC).<br/><br/><br/>cPRC and cARC manifest, despite the fact that IF neuron models are type I and characterized by their phase only being advanced regardless of the phase of perturbation, a network consisting of IF neurons produces a delay in phase followed by an advance followed by a delay, depending on the timing of the perturbation. Furthermore, the amplitude of the subsequent cycle undergoes an increase-decrease-increase cycle of changes in its strength. The model then predicts that applying a perturbation at the early and very late phase of the oscillation gives rise to a transient reduction of LFP frequency while applying that at the middle period of oscillation induces a transient increment in that.<br/><br/><br/>Our results suggest that the collective response of the oscillatory inhibitory networks are almost independent of the properties of the constituent neurons. As the collective response curve determine the efficacy of the communication and the signal exchange between the brain areas, this study can serve as an important step in understanding the mechanisms of inter-cortical communications.</p>
