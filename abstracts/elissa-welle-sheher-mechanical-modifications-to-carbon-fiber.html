        <h1>Mechanical modifications to carbon fiber electrodes increase recording yield in brain and enable interfacing with peripheral structures</h1><h2>Elissa Welle (she/her)</h2><h3>Paras Patel, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan; Ahmad Jiman, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan; Elizabeth Bottorff, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan; Tim Bruns, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan; Cynthia Chestek, Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Michigan, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Carbon fiber electrodes may enable better long-term brain and nerve interfaces by minimizing the tissue response commonly seen with silicon-based electrodes. Our recent modifications to a carbon fiber electrode surface using a laser or blowtorch has increased the recording yield and adaptability of the arrays in the brain and nerve, respectively. Past carbon fiber electrode arrays in the brain exhibited both high fidelity single unit recordings and a healthy neuronal population immediately adjacent to the recording site. We recently showed that using a 532nm laser instead of traditional microsurgical scissors for the creation of the electrode site increased the recording yield to 84% after 7 days and 71% after 63 days of chronic implant with PEDOT:pTS coating (N=45 fibers) (Welle et al., 2020), compared to a ~30% recording yield for scissor cut fibers. The laser cut electrodes created a consistent, sustainable 257 ± 13.8-µm2 electrode with low 1kHz impedance (19 ± 4kΩ with PEDOT:pTS) and low fiber-to-fiber variability. To enable peripheral nerve interfacing, where the insertion problem is more difficult, we used a 3mm butane flame to create sharpened carbon fiber electrodes that successfully inserted through the epineurium of nerve and dorsal root ganglion without a shuttle. The sharpened carbon fibers were on average 224µm in length with 147µm of exposed carbon and a tip angle of 72 degrees (N=24 fibers). We recorded spontaneous neural activity from rat cervical vagus nerve (Jiman et al., 2020) and feline dorsal root ganglion structures. Discernible single units were detected in physiologically relevant experiments, such as brushing and bladder filling. This work suggests that carbon fiber may be a viable material for higher channel count arrays for the peripheral nervous system. </p>
