        <h1>Age-related Differences in Visual-Vestibular Integration over Time of Exposure in VR Simulated Driving Environments</h1><h2>Robert Nowosielski</h2><h3>Robert J. Nowosielski, MSc, University of Toronto, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, ON; Bruce Haycock, PhD, University of Toronto, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, ON; Behrang Keshavarz, PhD; Ryerson University, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, ON; Jennifer Campos, PhD, University of Toronto, Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, ON</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Vestibular function is known to change with age, but the effects of these changes on functional behaviours requiring self-motion perception is largely unknown. Driving is a complex task that involves the use of vestibular inputs to guide self-motion perception and behaviours. However, the degree to which age-related changes in vestibular function affect driving performance has yet to be studied in an experimental setting. Driving simulators are an increasingly common tool for examining driving performance in a safe and controlled way, yet they differ widely in fidelity, including their motion capabilities. Using Toronto Rehabilitation Institute’s high-fidelity, full motion driving simulator, we measured the driving performance of older and younger drivers across three different physical motion conditions: no motion, rotational motion (yaw), and full motion (yaw, pitch, roll, and translational motion) using a between-subjects design (age x motion condition). We tested 34 younger adults aged 18 – 35 and 32 older adults aged 65+ using three, 15-minute driving scenarios for each motion condition. Driving performance was measured across 14 variables (e.g. speed variability, lane deviation). We hypothesized an additive and beneficial effect of motion (no motion to yaw, yaw to full motion) on driving performance (e.g. reduced speed variability, reduced lane deviations), with older adults benefiting more from additional motion components than younger adults. Our preliminary results demonstrate a more nuanced effect of motion, with older adults demonstrating a larger benefit from the addition of both yaw and full motion on driving performance, despite driving more poorly than younger adults overall. Furthermore, older adults demonstrated greater improvements in performance over drives than did younger adults. These findings suggest that age-related differences in how different motion types affect driving performance should not be viewed in terms of decrements in function, rather in unique perceptual and cognitive strategies in integrating multisensory information.</p>
