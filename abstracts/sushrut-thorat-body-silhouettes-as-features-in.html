        <h1>Body silhouettes as features in visual search: evidence from spatially-global attention modulation in visual cortex </h1><h2>Sushrut Thorat</h2><h3>Marius V. Peelen, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Visual search for objects in cluttered scenes is guided by top-down attention, allowing observers to efficiently select goal-relevant information from incoming visual input. When search is for low-level features, such as orientation, color, or motion direction, this attentional selection modulates visual processing across the visual field, even at spatially-unattended and task-irrelevant locations. Recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies have provided evidence that similar spatially-global selection mechanisms may exist for highly-familiar object categories such as faces. Similar to low-level features, faces are selectively represented in the visual system. In the present fMRI study, we reveal spatially-global modulation for another selectively-represented object category: human bodies. Participants were cued to search for one of six object categories in two vertically-aligned images. Crucially, two additional, horizontally-aligned, images were simultaneously presented but were never task-relevant across three experimental sessions. Analyses locked to the objects presented in these task-irrelevant images revealed that responses evoked by body silhouettes were strongly modulated by the participantsâ€™ top-down attentional set, becoming more body-selective when participants searched for bodies in the task-relevant images. These effects were observed both in univariate analyses of body-selective cortex and in multivariate analyses of high-level visual cortex. Finally, we found that this modulation reflected response gain rather than a generic bias induced by the cues. These findings provide evidence for a spatially-global selection mechanism for human bodies, linking this modulation to body-selective representations in high-level visual cortex.</p>
