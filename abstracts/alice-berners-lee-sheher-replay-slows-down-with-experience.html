        <h1>Replay slows down with experience</h1><h2>Alice Berners-Lee (she/her)</h2><h3>Ting Feng, Philips Research North America, Cambridge, MA; Delia Silva, 4 L.E.K. Life Sciences, Boston, MA; Xiaojing Wu, Comprehensive Epilepsy Ctr., NYU Langone Med. Ctr., New York, NY; Ellen Ambrose, Protenus, Baltimore, MD; Brad Pfeiffer, 7 Department of Neuroscience, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX; David Foster, University of California Berkeley</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The hippocampus is implicated in memory formation, and neurons in the hippocampus take part in replay sequences, time-compressed reactivations of trajectories through space the animal has previously explored. These replay sequences have been proposed to be a form of memory for previously experienced places. I will present work exploring how these replays appear and change with experience. By recording from large ensembles of hippocampal neurons as rats explored novel and familiar linear tracks in various experiments, we found that hippocampal replays appear after a single experience and slow down with subsequent experience as greater detail is incorporated. We also investigated hover-and-jump dynamics within replays that are associated with the slow gamma (25-50Hz) oscillation in the LFP and found that replays slow down by adding more hover locations, corresponding to depiction of the behavioral trajectory with increased resolution.  Thus, replays can reflect single experiences, and be rapidly modified by subsequent experience to incorporate more detail, consistent with their proposed role as a basic mechanism of hippocampally dependent memory.   </p>
