        <h1>Auditory Corticothalamic Neurons are Recruited by Motor Preparatory Inputs </h1><h2>Kameron Clayton</h2><h3>Kameron Clayton, Harvard Medical School; Ross Williamson, University of Pittsburgh; Gen-ichi Tasaka, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Adi Mizrahi, Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Troy Hackett, Vanderbilt University Medical Center; Daniel Polley, Harvard Medical School;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>During active sensing, neural responses to sensory inputs directly generated by our own movements are suppressed. In the auditory cortex (ACtx), self-initiated movements elicit corollary discharge from secondary motor cortex (M2) that suppresses pyramidal neuron (PyrN) spiking via recruitment of local inhibitory neurons. Using single unit electrophysiology, we observed that ACtx layer (L)6 PyrNs were also activated hundreds of milliseconds prior to movement onset, at approximately the same time as fast spiking inhibitory neurons. Most L6 PyrNs were corticothalamic (CT) cells, which all expressed FoxP2, a protein marker enriched in brain areas that integrate sensory inputs to control vocal motor behaviors. Using a combination of two-photon calcium imaging and optogenetically targeted single unit recordings, we found that L6 CTs were strongly activated prior to orofacial movements, but not locomotion. The specific recruitment by facial movements suggests that L6 CTs may receive a different source of motor input, beyond M2. Monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed that L6 CTs received ten times more direct inputs from the basal ganglia than M2. <br/>Our prior work found that optogenetic activation of L6 CTs reset the phase of low-frequency ACtx oscillations, modified sensory tuning in the thalamus and cortex, and switched perception into modes of enhanced detection or enhanced discrimination. Here, we show that preparatory facial movements can act like an optogenetic pulse, possibly priming cortical circuits for vocal feedback monitoring. These findings identify new pathways and local circuits for motor modulation of sound processing and suggest a new role for CT neurons in active sensing. <br/></p>
