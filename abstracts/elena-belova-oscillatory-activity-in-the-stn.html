        <h1>Oscillatory activity in the STN under PD: do we need to account for aperiodic broadband signal/activity and how it affects our data?</h1><h2>Elena Belova</h2><h3>Ulia Semenova, Semenov Institute for Chemical Physics, Anna Gamaleya, Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute, Alexey Tomskiy, Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute, Alexey Sedov, Semenov Institute of Chemical Physics </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia is under extensive research as it may contribute to motor dysfunction in Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD). Most of the studies deal with local field potentials (LFPs), which are thought to reflect activity of neuronal populations in the vicinity of the macroelectrode recording contact. The power of oscillations may be assessed using power spectral density estimates in the range of interest. However, every spectra has aperiodic broadband component (commonly viewed as noise) that is usually not taken into account. Recent research (Gao et al., 2017) has suggested that this aperiodic signal may reflect the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) projections. Besides, the slope of aperiodic component may affect the amplitude of oscillatory peaks and skew the perceived power of oscillations when measured without slope extraction. We aimed to compare the power of LFP oscillations in several bands using the conventional method and the method accounting for aperiodic component. LFP spectra were recorded in the subthalamic nucleus of parkinsonian patients undergoing DBS surgeries in 2017-2020 in Burdenko Neurosurgery Institute. We performed LFP recordings at rest and during voluntary movement (i.e. fist contraction). We searched for the association between oscillatory activity in several frequency bands and motor signs of PD and their sensitivity to motor tests using both methods. Here we provide the evidence supporting the idea that aperiodic broadband component in LFP spectra may carry meaningful information about E/I balance,  though this aperiodic signal does not affect significantly the associations found for LFP oscillations and motor function in PD.</p>
