Accumulated researches provided evidences that, early parent-child separation leads to the deficits in cognitive processes, education, emotion and health. However, the neural level of deficits of social cognition, which induced by parent-child separation in rural China is unclear. To evaluate these, we compared brain activation (the social interaction difference) and behavioral differences between 81 non /partially /completely left-behind children ages of 52-76 months (mean = 64.98 ± 6.321 months) in two joint attention tasks, i.e., IJA: initiating joint attention and RJA: response to joint attention, which was implemented with different interactive objects (teacher and stranger). Results demonstrated that higher prefrontal cortex (PFC) activation during joint attention tasks, higher activation in responding to stranger than teacher, especially in IJA, and the activation of joint attention positively associated with language score, cognitive flexibility and facial expression recognition. More importantly, partially-left-behind children evoked a higher brain activation in IJA tasks and presented a higher language level than completely/non-left-behind children. This study provided insight to neural basis in the development of left-behind children in rural China and revealed ‘Left-behind’ would not take the full responsibility of children’s social cognition deficits, family economic level and ‘left-behind’ together could contribute to the lower social cognition and brain development in children.</p>
