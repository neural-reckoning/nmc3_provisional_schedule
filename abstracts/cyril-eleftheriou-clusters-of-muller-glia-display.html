        <h1>Clusters of Müller glia display sporadic radial burst of activity after eye opening</h1><h2>Cyril Eleftheriou</h2><h3>Cyril Eleftheriou, Burke Neurological Institute; Carlo Corona, Burke Neurological Institute; Paola Bianchimano, Burke Neurological Institute; Elena Ivanova, Burke Neurological Institute; Botir Sagdullaev, Burke Neurological Institute</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Müller glia are an import populations of cells in the retina mediating  a wide array of functions including immune response, neurotransmitter recycling, structural support, metabolic support and light-guidance. Although they have been known to connect to each other via gap junctions, their ability to propagate waves of activity, similar to retinal and cortical astrocytes, has never been demonstrated. 
We characterized the live spontaneous calcium dynamics of neurons and glia throughout the layers of murine retinas expressing GCaMP6f in neurons and glia (under the NG2 promoter) at key developmental stages: Stage II retinal Waves (P10-11), Eye opening (P14-15), Early vision (P20-22), and Adult Vision (P60-90). Calcium dynamics were imaged using multiphoton microscopy on live ex-vivo retinal explants of 6 mice per condition.
Groups of Muller glia displayed spontaneous burst of calcium fluorescence, in a coordinated manner, and displaying a radial propagation profile. These spontaneous coordinated events were abolished by the pharmacological application of glutamate antagonists, indicating a potential point of origin. Interestingly, these events only appeared regularly after eye opening. In the 9 explants (n = 6 mice) investigated aged P10-11, only 1 such event was observed, whilst they displayed average frequencies over 0.12 (± 0.03 SEM) events/min after eye opening. 
Our investigations provide a novel observation in an understudied cell-type which could lead to a better understanding of the signaling between neurons and glia in visual signal processing of the retina.
