        <h1>Clusters of Müller glia display sporadic radial burst of activity after eye opening</h1><h2>Cyril Eleftheriou</h2><h3>Cyril Eleftheriou, Burke Neurological Institute; Carlo Corona, Burke Neurological Institute; Paola Bianchimano, Burke Neurological Institute; Elena Ivanova, Burke Neurological Institute; Botir Sagdullaev, Burke Neurological Institute</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Müller glia are an import populations of cells in the retina mediating  a wide array of functions including immune response, neurotransmitter recycling, structural support, metabolic support and light-guidance. Although they have been known to connect to each other via gap junctions, their ability to propagate waves of activity, similar to retinal and cortical astrocytes, has never been demonstrated. <br/>We characterized the live spontaneous calcium dynamics of neurons and glia throughout the layers of murine retinas expressing GCaMP6f in neurons and glia (under the NG2 promoter) at key developmental stages: Stage II retinal Waves (P10-11), Eye opening (P14-15), Early vision (P20-22), and Adult Vision (P60-90). Calcium dynamics were imaged using multiphoton microscopy on live ex-vivo retinal explants of 6 mice per condition.<br/>Groups of Muller glia displayed spontaneous burst of calcium fluorescence, in a coordinated manner, and displaying a radial propagation profile. These spontaneous coordinated events were abolished by the pharmacological application of glutamate antagonists, indicating a potential point of origin. Interestingly, these events only appeared regularly after eye opening. In the 9 explants (n = 6 mice) investigated aged P10-11, only 1 such event was observed, whilst they displayed average frequencies over 0.12 (± 0.03 SEM) events/min after eye opening. <br/>Our investigations provide a novel observation in an understudied cell-type which could lead to a better understanding of the signaling between neurons and glia in visual signal processing of the retina.  <br/></p>
