While kinematic parameters such as peaks and jerk are well established in assessing motor efficiency in humans and non-human primate models, they have not been validated in rodent models. Traditionally, motor function in mice is qualitatively assessed by observation and there is a need for a standard to quantify motor function. Validation of these parameters for analyzing motor function would provide a new perspective for quantitating individual variation in motor learning and execution for mouse models of motor related disorders. We sought to answer if these known kinematic parameters in humans could predict individual variation in motor efficiency in mice during the single pellet-grasping assay. Mice were food restricted to increase motivation to reach for a high reward food pellet and were recorded for 10 minutes a day for 4 days while attempting to retrieve the pellet. Individual reaches were manually tracked using Tracker Motion Analysis Software to extract time position data to derive peaks and jerk. Peaks of failed reaches decreased significantly with progressive training and were comparable to peaks of successful reaches, suggesting that peaks may be a predictive measure of motion efficiency in mice. Jerk may not be a sensitive enough measure to quantify motor performance in mice during the single pellet-grasping assay. The observation that the number of peaks decreases with motor training is consistent with previous studies in humans. Thus, peaks serve as a quantitative measure for studying learning and execution of fine motor skills in mice.</p>
