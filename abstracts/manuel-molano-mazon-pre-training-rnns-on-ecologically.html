        <h1>Pre-training RNNs on ecologically relevant tasks explains rats suboptimal behavior in a simple categorization task </h1><h2>Manuel Molano-Maz√≥n</h2><h3>Manuel Molano-Mazon, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; Daniel Duque-Doncos, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain; Guangyu Robert Yang, Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, Columbia University, New York, USA; Jaime de la Rocha, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In order to make optimal decisions in real-world environments it is fundamental to take into account recent stimuli and the actions made in response to them, together with the outcomes of those actions. A recent study (Hermoso-Mendizabal et al.) has shown that rats are able to leverage the information contained in the trial history of a perceptual two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task that includes serial correlations in the trial sequence. However, rats only used this trial history information after correct trials and failed to do so after error trials, when they temporarily followed a strategy only based on the current stimulus. Here we use RNNs to investigate whether this reset strategy reflects an adaptive mechanism or alternatively reveals fundamental limits in the capacity of simple neural circuits to perform counterfactual inference.     <br/>We trained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in the same 2AFC task used for rats and found that the networks, like the rats, learned to leverage the sequence partial predictability  to increase their categorization accuracy after correct trials. However, RNNS also used this predictability after error trials departing from the reset strategy of the rats and resembling the behavior of an optimal agent that can perform counterfactual inference. <br/>We hypothesize that the discrepancy between the rats and RNNs behavior is due to the fact that networks are fully optimizing their performance in the 2AFC task whereas the brain of rats has been shaped by evolution in order to optimize their performance in more ecological environments. As a consequence, although rats manage to perform well in the task, they are not able to fully adapt their behavior to it. We show that by pre-training the RNNs in the same task but using a number of choices larger than two, they exhibit  the reset strategy displayed by the rats, which is close to an optimal behavior in a more complex environment with multiple options.<br/>Our results suggest that seemingly sub-optimal behaviors in laboratory tasks (e.g. the reset strategy) can be a byproduct of the adaptation to more complex environments. Furthermore, our work demonstrates the usefulness of pre-training artificial neural networks in ecologically plausible environments before testing them on the task of interest.<br/></p>
