        <h1>Vagus nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical and behavioral activation</h1><h2>Lindsay Collins</h2><h3>Laura Boddington, David McCormick</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is currently used to manage a variety of neurological disorders, although the mechanisms underlying therapeutic benefits are unclear. We hypothesized that VNS may activate widespread regions of the brain via neuromodulatory projections and ultimately alter cortical and behavioral state. We tested this prediction in mice surgically implanted with a vagus nerve cuff electrode. Pupillometry and behavioral analysis in awake head-fixed mice demonstrated that VNS dose-dependently induces a change in behavioral state. Widefield calcium imaging of excitatory neurons revealed that VNS activates multiple regions of the cortex, including motor, somatosensory, retrosplenial, visual, and auditory cortical areas. Widespread cortical activation evoked by VNS was maintained under light isoflurane anesthesia, indicating that VNS activates the cortex above and beyond that resulting from VNS-induced motor activity. Two-photon calcium imaging and multiunit recordings of excitatory cortical neurons confirmed that VNS excites layer 2/3 cells in both awake and anesthetized states. The vagus nerve innervates the noradrenergic locus coeruleus which sends broad neuromodulatory projections throughout the brain including the cortex and the cholinergic basal forebrain.  Noradrenaline and acetylcholine are both heavily implicated in modulation of cortical and behavioral state, so we predicted that the observed effects of VNS on cortical excitation and arousal state may occur via activation of these neuromodulatory pathways. Using 2-photon calcium imaging of cortical axons we demonstrated that VNS activates both noradrenergic and cholinergic cells. Together, our results support a model of VNS in which stimulation results in activation of broadly projecting neuromodulatory systems, a widespread increase in cortical excitation, and an increase in arousal state. </p>
