        <h1>The time course of decision-making: contribution of the electrophysiological version of the monetary incentive delay (e-MID) task </h1><h2>Inês Macedo</h2><h3>Carina Fernandes; Helena Garcez; Ana R. Gonçalves; Fernando Barbosa; João Marques-Teixeira</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task is a popular tool for studying the different stages of economic decision-making. During this task, participants are presented with a cue that signals possible gains/losses. This cue is followed by target detection, which requires a button press to win/avoid losses. Then, feedback reveals the success/failure of the performance. The MID task has been extensively used to investigate neural activity associated with different stages of decision-making. Specifically, the cues elicit affective processes of gain/loss anticipation (anticipation processes), which induce positive/negative arousal, and motivate approach/avoidance behaviors. The output of this process is integrated (integration processes) with further evaluative considerations, feeding in motivation processes that promote subsequent motor actions and decisions. Also, the delivery of the results elicits neural activity associated with the processing of gains and losses. This study exploits the temporal resolution of EEG to identify the neural correlates associated with these processes. To this purpose, 28 healthy younger adults performed a version of the MID task adapted to an ERP technique. The anticipation processes were analyzed through the cue-P3, which is correlated with the engagement of proactive cognitive control that increases in function of the reinforcement amount. The integration processes were analyzed through the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) elicited by the cue, which is associated with the engagement of effortful processes to future motor responses. The motivation processes beyond motor choice were analyzed through the Lateralized Readiness Potential (LRP) and the target-P3. The LRP reflects the voluntary motor response after the decision threshold, while the target-P3 is elicited by the target and is modulated by the task-relevance and motivated attention. Finally, the feedback processes were analyzed through the frontocentral feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the feedback-P3. These ERPs were elicited by gain, loss and neutral gamble, and were compared in a within-subjects design.  </p>
