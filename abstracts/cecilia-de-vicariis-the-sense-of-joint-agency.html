        <h1>The Sense of Joint Agency in Sensorimotor Interaction</h1><h2>Cecilia De Vicariis</h2><h3>Vinil T. Chackochan, Bournemoth University; Vittorio Sanguineti, University of Genoa</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Computational models have provided important contributions to unveiling the mechanisms underlying individual action and the sense of self agency – the subjective feeling of being in control of our own actions. The development of computational models is even more necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying joint actions and the subjective experiences of control which emerge during this kind of situations. 
Understanding the partner and choosing mutually satisfactory strategies are key components in joint action and in the development of the sense of joint agency. The development of a partner representation is incorporated in the process of state estimation and, with the body predictions, determines the selection of the control strategies. Game theory - the study of strategic interaction of self-interested agents – constitutes a natural extension of optimal control when multiple agents are involved.
Here we propose a modular computational architecture, which integrates the classical motor control theories - optimal estimation and optimal control - and extends them to reconcile the sense of self and joint agency during interactions. 
Models and simulations based on optimal estimation and game theory provide insights regarding what we represent of a partner, which strategies we adopt and how these strategies evolve with time and training during joint action. They also provide a conceptual basis for extending the notion of self agency to that of joint agency. 
The sense of agency is described in probabilistic terms, as a dynamic decision process, which continuously evaluates the assumptions underlying each observer-controller pair of the proposed modular architecture. Agency relates to reasoning about ourselves: our role in the action, the perceived features of our body and environment, presence of additional partners or opponents; their actions and intentions. During movements, the sense of agency gates each control signal thus providing the basis for optimal action selection.
