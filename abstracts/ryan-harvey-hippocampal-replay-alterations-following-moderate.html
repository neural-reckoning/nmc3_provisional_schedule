        <h1>Hippocampal replay alterations following moderate prenatal alcohol exposure</h1><h2>Ryan Harvey</h2><h3>Ryan E. Harvey, University of New Mexico; Laura E. Berkowitz, University of New Mexico; Benjamin J. Clark, University of New Mexico</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is among the most common developmental insults to the nervous system and is characterized by memory impairment. There is a need to identify physiological changes that help explain this memory impairment. Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs) and associated replay events are potential candidates as they are the electrophysiological signatures of memory reactivation and consolidation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that SPW-Rs and replay events are altered following PAE. To test this hypothesis, we recorded single-unit and local field potentials from hippocampal subregions CA1 & CA3 of moderate PAE & control rats while they made laps on a linear track and while at rest on a pedestal. Preliminary findings suggest that replay and SPW-Rs are altered following PAE. Specifically, replayed trajectories are truncated and SPW-R frequencies are slowed. The results from these experiments provide a novel framework for investigating hippocampal mechanisms of memory impairment associated with PAE and may also provide potential functional biomarkers following PAE.</p>
