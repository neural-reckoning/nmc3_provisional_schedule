        <h1>Role of Path Information in Visual Perception of Joint Stiffness </h1><h2>Aaron West (he/him/his)</h2><h3>Aaron Michael West Jr., Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Meghan Huber, Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Massachusetts Amherst; Neville Hogan, Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Humans have an astonishing ability to extract hidden information from the movement of others. In previous work, subjects observed the motion of a simulated stick-figure, two-link planar arm and estimated its stiffness. Fundamentally, stiffness is the relation between force and displacement. Given that subjects were unable to physically interact with the simulated arm, they were forced to make their estimates solely based on observed kinematic information. Remarkably, subjects were able to correctly correlate their stiffness estimates with changes in the simulated stiffness, despite lack of force information. We posit that subjects were only able to do this because the controller used to produce the simulated arm’s movement, composed of oscillatory motions driving mechanical impedances, resembled the controller humans use to produce their own movement. However, it is still unknown how this controller is encoded in the nervous system, and consequently, what motion features subjects used to determine their stiffness rating. Human motion exhibits systematic velocity-curvature patterns, and these patterns play an important role in perceiving and interpreting motion. Thus, we hypothesized that manipulating the velocity profile should affect subjects’ ability to estimate stiffness. To test this, we changed the velocity profile of the simulated two-link planar arm while keeping the simulated endpoint paths the same. Even with manipulated velocity signals, subjects were still able to estimate changes in simulated joint stiffness with the same level of accuracy observed in the original experiment. These results suggest that path information predominates over temporal information when humans use visual observation to estimate stiffness.</p>
