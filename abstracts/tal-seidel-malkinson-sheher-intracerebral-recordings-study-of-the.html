        <h1>Intracerebral recordings study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of human exogenous attention</h1><h2>Tal Seidel Malkinson (she/her)</h2><h3>Dimitri J Bayle; Alexia Bourgeois; Katia Lehongre; Vincent Navarro; Claude Adam; Jacobo D Sitt; Paolo Bartolomeo</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Our attention is automatically captured by salient events, a process called exogenous attention orienting. We explored the neural basis of two exogenous attention related effects: response time facilitation (RT facilitation) and inhibition of return (IOR). How fast we respond to a stimulus depends on whether it appears in a previously attended location, for example if a target-stimulus was preceded or not by an exogenous cue. However, this cueing effect changes according to the cue-to-target delay: short delays lead to faster responses in cued locations (RT Facilitation), while delays that are only slightly longer inverse this pattern and lead to faster responses to uncued locations (IOR). A method with high temporal resolution is required to study the neural correlates of these fast and dynamic processes. Here, data were recorded from 28 epileptic patients implanted with depth electrodes as a part of their medical treatment (1407 contacts), providing a unique opportunity to directly measure human neurophysiology with excellent spatio-temporal resolution. Patients performed the Posner paradigm with peripheral cues, while their neural responses were recorded. We studied the neural activity through a data-driven clustering approach, to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of target-related activity. We identified specific neural clusters showing segregated cue and target related responses when the delay was long, but an integrated response to cue and target when the delay was short. Clusters varied in their sensitivity to the stimulus location, stimulus identity (cue or target) and response latency. These clusters may contribute to the computations underlying exogenous attention related effects. </p>
