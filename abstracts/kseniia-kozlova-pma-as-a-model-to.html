        <h1>pMA as a model to study the somatotopy of the interhemispheric interaction</h1><h2>Kseniia Kozlova</h2><h3>Kseniia Kozlova 1, Maria Mitina1,  Pavel Novikov1, Vadim Nikulin1,2 and Maria Nazarova1,3, 1 Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia; 2 Max Planck Institute, Leipzig, Germany , 3 Federal State Budgetary Institution «Federal center of brain and neurotechnologies»  of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Physiological mirror activity (pMA) is an involuntary muscle activity in one limb muscles that happens when muscles of the opposite limb are strongly contracted. This phenomenon reflects the interhemispheric balance in the motor system. We hypothesize that pMA may serve as a model for studying the somatotopy of the interhemispheric interactions. We assume that pMA would be more prominent in the homologue muscles of the opposite hand compared to non-homologue muscles.<br/>We obtained the  preliminary results from 11 healthy right handed participants (7 females, 19 to 28 y.o.). Surface EMG was recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis, first dorsal interosseous, abductor digiti minimi from both hands. Extensor carpi ulnaris and flexor carpi ulnaris were used as control muscles. Subjects performed three motor tasks (thumb abduction, index finger extension, little finger abduction) in a pseudo-random order with their right hand while pMA was measured in the left.<br/><br/>We observed pMA in the left hand muscles in 9 out of 12 participants with presence of < 50% of the trials. pMA tended to increase with the repetitions in the experiment course. Average pick-to-pick amplitude of pMA was 150 μV, while pMA latency varied between 50ms to 4500 ms. With regard to the pMA somatotopy, the phenomenon was more prominent in homologues muscles than in non-homologues ones. <br/><br/>One of the obstacles we faced was that in some subjects in the active hand the isolated isometric contraction of one muscle without other co-located muscles was not possible. Further analysis, relating to demixing of EMG signal from the closely located muscles,<br/>will be developed and performed.</p>
