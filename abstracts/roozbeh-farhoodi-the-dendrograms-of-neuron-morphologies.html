        <h1>The Dendrograms of Neuron Morphologies exhibit Asymmetrical Motifs</h1><h2>Roozbeh Farhoodi</h2><h3>Roozbeh Farhoodi, David Rolnick, Konrad Paul Kording</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Despite the beauty of neuron morphologies and their potential contributions to computation, we lack a geometric understanding of their structure. A common way of describing trees is in terms of their dendrograms, raising the question of how they may differ across neuron types. Here we characterize the distribution of dendrogram motifs. We construct generative models of trees that allow asymmetric, as well as depth dependent growth. Across many neuron types, we find that an asymmetric model outperforms a symmetric one. We also find strong differences in asymmetry across species. We suggest that neuroscience needs to understand the structure of neuron morphologies if it is to understand computation in the brain.</p>
