        <h1>On the necessity of recurrent processing during object recognition: it depends on the need for scene segmentation </h1><h2>Noor Seijdel</h2><h3>Jessica Loke, University of Amsterdam; Ron van de Klundert; Matthew van der Meer; Eva Quispel; Simon van Gaal, University of Amsterdam; Edward H.F. de Haan, University of Amsterdam; H. Steven Scholte, University of Amsterdam;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>While feed-forward activity may suffice for recognizing objects in sparse scenes, additional visual operations that aid object recognition might be needed for more complex scenes. One such additional operation is figure-ground segmentation; extracting the relevant features and locations of the target object while ignoring irrelevant features. In this study of 60 participants, we show objects on backgrounds of increasing complexity to investigate whether recurrent computations are increasingly important for segmenting objects from more complex backgrounds. Three lines of evidence show that recurrent processing is critical for recognition of objects embedded in complex scenes. First, behavioral results indicated a greater reduction in performance after masking objects presented on more complex backgrounds; with the degree of impairment increasing with increasing background complexity. Second, electroencephalography (EEG) measurements showed clear differences in the evoked response potentials (ERPs) between conditions around 200ms - a time point beyond feed-forward activity and object decoding based on the EEG signal indicated later decoding onsets for objects embedded in more complex backgrounds. Third, Deep Convolutional Neural Network performance confirmed this interpretation; feed-forward and less deep networks showed a higher degree of impairment in recognition for objects in complex backgrounds compared to recurrent and deeper networks. Together, these results support the notion that recurrent computations drive figure-ground segmentation of objects in complex scenes.</p>
