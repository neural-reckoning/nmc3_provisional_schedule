        <h1>A Multiscale Cortico-Basal Ganglia Model for Arm Reaching Task in Normal and Parkinsonian Conditions</h1><h2>Sandeep Sathyanandan Nair</h2><h3>Sandeep Sathyanandan Nair, Indian Institute of Technology Madras; Vignayanandam R. Muddapu, Indian Institute of Technology Madras; V. Srinivasa Chakravarthy,Indian Institute of Technology Madras</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A major underlying cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is the idiopathic loss of dopaminergic neurons in Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). Dopamine deficiency due to the loss of SNc neurons manifests in cardinal symptoms of PD, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural imbalance. To investigate the PD condition in detail and manage its symptoms, it is important to have an integrated multiscale computational model that can replicate the symptoms at the behavioral level by evoking some of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the pathology. In line with this, we developed a multiscale integrated model of cortico-basal ganglia motor circuitry for arm reaching task incorporating a detailed biophysical model of SNc dopaminergic neuron. Computational models of the basal ganglia tend to take a dichotomous approach, describing exclusively at a detailed biophysical level or at abstract information processing level using concepts from Reinforcement Learning (RL), without working out the relationship between the two levels.  In our model, we replace the abstract representations of reward with the realistic variable of extracellular dopamine released by a network of SNc cells and incorporate it with the RL-based behavioral model, which simulates the reaching task. Our results showed that as SNc cell loss increases, the success rate in reaching the target decreased, while the average reaching time increased. In addition, the biophysical model of SNc allows us to explore an important hypothesis related to the cause of PD - the link between cellular energy deficiency and the death of dopaminergic cells. The RL-based behavioral component of the model gives us the flexibility to simulate the various PD symptoms e.g. tremor and bradykinesia. We conclude that our model presents a realistic and efficient way of simulating arm reaching task in normal and Parkinsonian conditions, thereby allowing us to understand how neurochemical dysfunction leads to behavioral abnormalities.</p>
