        <h1>Lateralized Short-Term and Long-Term Plasticity of Somatostatin-Positive Interneurons in Female Mouse Auditory Cortex</h1><h2>Soomin Song (He, Him)</h2><h3>Robert C. Froemke, NYU</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>There are multiple forms of synaptic plasticity, and distinct inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron can have qualitatively different learning rules (Maheux et al. 2015). There is growing evidence that cortical inhibitory synapses are highly plastic, including differences in cell-type-specific GABAergic inputs onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons (Chiu et al. Neuron 2018). In the auditory cortex, we have found that an unusual left-lateralized form of short-term inhibitory depression might help enable longer-term changes to both excitation and inhibition for enhanced responses to pup calls in maternal mice (Marlin et al. Nature 2015, Schiavo et al. Nature 2020). 

Here we examined short-term and spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of different inhibitory inputs onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of adult mouse auditory cortex in slices. STDP is a method for inducing input-specific and long-term modifications of synaptic strength, where short-term plasticity reflects the dynamic synaptic strength based on recent history. These mechanisms might underlie the synchronization of stimulus-evoked inhibitory input during development (Dorrn et al. Nature 2010, Field et al. Neuron 2020) and after conditioning or maternal experience. 
	
We utilized isolated expression of channelrhodopsin-2 in various GABAergic interneurons to selectively activate these inputs. Somatostatin interneurons are distinct physiologically, expressing STDP (169% potentiated current, n = 11, p < 0.05) as compared to PV, VIP and Layer-1 interneurons. Somatostatin also demonstrate differential depression to repetitive stimulation (df = 3, F = 3.26, p < 0.05), depending on hemisphere, as compared to PV. Our data suggest somatostatin interneurons are critical for laterality in the auditory cortex.</p>
