        <h1>How do the blind ‘see’?  The role of spontaneous brain activity in self-generated perception</h1><h2>Avital Hahamy</h2><h3>Meytal Wilf, MySpace Lab, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland; Boris Rosin, Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem 91120, Israel; Marlene Behrmann, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213, USA; Rafael Malach, Department of Neurobiology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, 7610001, Israel</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Spontaneous brain activity has long been studied, but little is known about its behavioral implications. It has previously been hypothesized that spontaneous brain activity underlies unprompted (internally-generated) behavior. Here, we test whether spontaneous brain activity might underlie internally-generated vision. We test this hypothesis by studying the cortical visual system of five blind individuals who experience vivid visual hallucinations (Charles Bonnet Syndrome, CBS). Neural populations in the visual system of these individuals are deprived of external input, which may lead to their hyper-sensitization to spontaneous activity fluctuations. To test whether these spontaneous fluctuations can subserve visual hallucinations, the fMRI brain activity of CBS participants obtained while they reported their hallucinations (spontaneous internally-generated vision) was compared to the : 1) brain activity evoked by veridical vision (externally-triggered vision) in sighted controls who were presented with a visual simulation of the hallucinatory streams; and 2) brain activity of non-hallucinating blind controls during visual imagery (cued internally-generated vision). All conditions showed activity spanning large portions of the visual system. However, only the hallucination condition in the CBS participants demonstrated unique temporal dynamics, characterized by a build-up of neural activity prior to the reported onset of hallucinations. This build-up was most pronounced in early visual cortex and then decayed along the visual hierarchy. These results suggest that, in the absence of external visual input, a build-up of spontaneous fluctuations in early visual cortex may activate the visual hierarchy, thereby triggering the experience of vision. </p>
