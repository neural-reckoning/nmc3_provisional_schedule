        <h1>Dynamic analysis of eye-head movements for estimating visuo-cognitive demands during driving</h1><h2>Laura Mikula (she/her)</h2><h3>Sergio Mejía-Romero, Université de Montréal; Romain Chaumillon, Université de Montréal; Amigale Patoine, Université de Montréal; Eduardo Lugo, Université de Montréal; Delphine Bernardin Université de Montréal, Essilor International; Jocelyn Faubert Université de Montréal</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Driving is a complex activity involving visuo-cognitive processes and failure to meet visual and/or cognitive needs can potentially affect drivers’ safety. Previous studies have shown that eye and head movements contribute to attention reallocation and they are both modulated by visuo-cognitive demands (Doshi et al., 2012; Fang et al., 2015). This study seeks to investigate the effect of visual degradation and increased cognitive demands on drivers’ eye-head movements and their ability to maneuver a vehicle in a driving simulator.
Twenty-one participants (21-34 years old) completed a driving task in which they were asked to maintain their speed constant while doing a concurrent visual task. Every participant performed the experiment with normal vision and with contact lenses inducing a visual degradation. Parameters such as speed and car lateral position were measured in the driving simulator; eye and head movements were recorded through motion capture. Visual exploration was analyzed using spatial and dynamic parameters.
Our results revealed that driving speed, but not car lateral position, was affected by visuo-cognitive demands (p < 0.05). Spatio-temporal parameters typically used to describe visual exploration (i.e. fixation duration, gaze position along horizontal and vertical axes) were not modulated by the visual degradation (all p > 0.05). In contrast, entropy showed that visual scanning was less explorative (p < 0.05) and participants recruited more head movements for horizontal gaze shifts (p = 0.03) when vision was degraded.
In conclusion, we showed that participants’ ability to maneuvering a vehicle while engaged in a secondary task remains relatively intact when vision is not optimal. We also provided evidence that eye-head movements and dynamic visual exploration are sensitive to the quality of vision and could be used as potential indicators of visuo-cognitive demands in more naturalistic tasks, such as driving.</p>
