        <h1>Dynamic analysis of eye-head movements for estimating visuo-cognitive demands during driving</h1><h2>Laura Mikula (she/her)</h2><h3>Sergio Mejía-Romero, Université de Montréal; Romain Chaumillon, Université de Montréal; Amigale Patoine, Université de Montréal; Eduardo Lugo, Université de Montréal; Delphine Bernardin Université de Montréal, Essilor International; Jocelyn Faubert Université de Montréal</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Driving is a complex activity involving visuo-cognitive processes and failure to meet visual and/or cognitive needs can potentially affect drivers’ safety. Previous studies have shown that eye and head movements contribute to attention reallocation and they are both modulated by visuo-cognitive demands (Doshi et al., 2012; Fang et al., 2015). This study seeks to investigate the effect of visual degradation and increased cognitive demands on drivers’ eye-head movements and their ability to maneuver a vehicle in a driving simulator.<br/>Twenty-one participants (21-34 years old) completed a driving task in which they were asked to maintain their speed constant while doing a concurrent visual task. Every participant performed the experiment with normal vision and with contact lenses inducing a visual degradation. Parameters such as speed and car lateral position were measured in the driving simulator; eye and head movements were recorded through motion capture. Visual exploration was analyzed using spatial and dynamic parameters.<br/>Our results revealed that driving speed, but not car lateral position, was affected by visuo-cognitive demands (p < 0.05). Spatio-temporal parameters typically used to describe visual exploration (i.e. fixation duration, gaze position along horizontal and vertical axes) were not modulated by the visual degradation (all p > 0.05). In contrast, entropy showed that visual scanning was less explorative (p < 0.05) and participants recruited more head movements for horizontal gaze shifts (p = 0.03) when vision was degraded.<br/>In conclusion, we showed that participants’ ability to maneuvering a vehicle while engaged in a secondary task remains relatively intact when vision is not optimal. We also provided evidence that eye-head movements and dynamic visual exploration are sensitive to the quality of vision and could be used as potential indicators of visuo-cognitive demands in more naturalistic tasks, such as driving.</p>
