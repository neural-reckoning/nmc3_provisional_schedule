        <h1>Categorical representation by suppression or enhancement of auditory stimuli during perceptual learning</h1><h2>Kathleen Martin (she/her)</h2><h3>Kathleen A Martin, New York University School of Medicine Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University Center for Neural Science, New York University School of Medicine Neuroscience Institute; Colin Bredenberg, New York University Center for Neural Science; Eero Simoncelli, New York University Center for Neural Science; Cristina Savin, New York University Center for Neural Science; & Robert C Froemke, New York University School of Medicine Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University Center for Neural Science, New York University School of Medicine Neuroscience Institute, Howard Hughes Medical Institute Faculty Scholar</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Perceptual learning reliably enhances cortical representations of task-relevant stimuli in trained animals. However, these neural changes have predominantly been observed outside of behavioral context and regardless of learning rate. Our lab found that engagement in behavior alters auditory cortical responses via local inhibition and cholinergic signaling (Kuchibhotla et al., 2017). Here, we examined how sensory representations in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons change over auditory perceptual learning in mice on a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task. <br/><br/>We performed simultaneous 2-photon imaging of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in auditory cortex throughout 2AFC auditory conditioning in head-fixed mice. To obtain water reward, animals learned to lick a left lick port for tones of a single, target frequency (11-16 kHz) and right for tones of all other frequencies. Discrimination between target (left) and surround (right) frequencies improved over 9-21 days. While animals were task-engaged, ~50% of stimulus-responsive excitatory neurons exhibited a categorical response, not encoding the frequency of the stimulus, but rather the behavioral choice on that trial. We observed two distinct population-level tuning in experienced animals; animals exhibited either a relative enhancement or suppression of the frequencies reported as target. <br/><br/>Using chronic two-photon imaging to track neurons longitudinally, we examined when these response profiles emerged during learning. We could detect whether an animal would likely exhibit enhancement or suppression as early as day 6 in behavioral learning. We developed a network model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to explore what may account for these individual differences and how they arise over learning. <br/></p>
