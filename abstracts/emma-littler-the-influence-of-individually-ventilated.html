        <h1>The Influence of Individually Ventilated Cage Conditions on Rats’ Anxiety-Related Behaviours</h1><h2>Emma Littler</h2><h3>Emma Littler, Queen's University; Jessica MacKay, Queen's University; Janet Menard, Queen's University </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In recent years, many animal research facilities have transitioned from using traditional open-top cages (OTCs) to using individually ventilated cages (IVCs) to house rodent colonies. Although the use of IVCs has clear benefits, there have been unanticipated drawbacks. Some research has suggested that IVCs may lead to increased rodent stress levels, however, the exact cause for this increase remains unknown. One cage-condition that is unique to IVCs, and may be responsible for increasing stress levels, is the air pressure environment inside the cage. IVCs can be operated under negative or positive pressure, however, little is known about how air pressure might influence behaviour. The social housing of rodents in OTCs is known to buffer rodents’ responses to stress, and is a well-validated phenomenon termed “social buffering”. At present, it is unknown if this phenomenon carries over to rodents housed in IVCs, and if this “social buffering” response is dependent on the type of air pressure. Rats were randomly assigned to single- or paired-housing in IVCs under negative or positive pressure. Five weeks after housing assignment, rats’ anxiety-like behaviour was measured in the elevated plus maze (EPM), and their brain tissue was processed to examine oxytocin-immunoreactivity (OT-ir) in the hypothalamus. The anxiety-reducing effects of pair-housing were only evident in rats housed under positive pressure. Although there were no differences in the number of OT-ir cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus between single- and pair-housed animals, a higher number of OT-ir cells in the PVN was significantly correlated with decreased anxiety-like behaviour. These findings suggest that IVCs may be altering well-validated behavioural profiles in rodents, and this may be in part due to the unique cage-conditions that IVCs present. As such, this research aims to improve the welfare of laboratory rodents by refining and improving their housing conditions.   </p>
