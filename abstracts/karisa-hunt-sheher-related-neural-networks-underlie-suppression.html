        <h1>Related Neural Networks Underlie Suppression of Emotion, Memory, Motor Processes as Identified by Data-Driven Analysis</h1><h2>Karisa Hunt (she/her)</h2><h3>Lindsay K. Knight, INSIGHTEC; Brendan E. Depue, University of Louisville</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Goal-directed behavior benefits from self-regulation of cognitive and affective processes, such as emotional reactivity, memory retrieval, and prepotent motor response. Dysfunction in self-regulation is a common characteristic of many psychiatric disorders, such as PTSD and ADHD. This study sought to determine whether common neural regions are involved in the regulation of emotion, motor, and memory, and if a data-driven approach using independent components analysis (ICA) would successfully identify intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) that contribute to inhibitory regulation. Eighteen participants underwent neuroimaging while completing an emotion regulation (ER) task, a memory suppression (think/no-think; TNT) task, and a motor inhibition (stop signal; SS) task. In the ER task, participants were presented with negatively valenced pictures and instructed to either feel or inhibit their emotions. In the TNT task, participants received training to remember face-picture (cue-target) pairs. Participants were then presented with only the cue and told to either recall the picture or try to block its retrieval. In the SS task, participants were presented with either a stop- or go-signal and instructed to press a button only at the go-signal â€“ not before the go-signal or at the stop-signal. ICA (CONN; MATLAB) was conducted on the neuroimaging data. Corresponding components were selected across task based on interrelated patterns of activation. Subsequently, ICNs were correlated with behavioral variables. ICA indicated a common medial prefrontal network, striatal network, and frontoparietal executive control network, as well as down-regulation in task-specific ROIs. These results illustrate that overlapping ICNs were exhibited across three distinct inhibitory regulation tasks as successfully identified through a data-driven approach (ICA).</p>
