        <h1>Disrupted experience-dependent place cell coding in rats heterozygous for the calcium channel gene Cacna1c</h1><h2>Ed Morrell</h2><h3>Jeremy Hall, Cardiff University; Lawrence S Wilkinson, Cardiff University; Matt W. Jones, University of Bristol</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Genome-wide association studies reveal that variants of CACNA1C, a gene encoding the Î±1 pore-forming subunit of the L-Type calcium channel, confer risk for psychiatric disorders across diagnostic categories. Heterozygosity for this gene in rodents has been associated with hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits and related cognitive impairment. What is not yet known however, is how synaptic deficits disrupt neuronal and network activity to compromise behavioural function. We sought to bridge this gap by quantifying place-cell dynamics in Cacna1c heterozygous (Cacna1c+/-) rats. <br/>We recorded dorsal CA1 single unit and local field potential activity in adult Cacna1c+/- rats during free exploration of familiar and novel environments, and during rest. Place-fields were normal in a novel environment yet enlarged on a linear track in Cacna1c+/- rats, with an associated reduction of place-cell spatial information. During rest, despite intact sharp-wave ripple oscillations, Cacna1c+/- rats exhibited overexcitation of place-cells during ripples. In contrast, cross-correlated activity between place-cell pairs during ripples was markedly impaired. In addition, a loss of correlation between spike-timing and place-field distance between cell pairs during ripples was observed during the rest period following free exploration in Cacna1c+/- rats, indicating an impairment in ripple-associated reactivation of spatial codes.<br/>These results point towards a deficit in the consolidation of spatial memory in Cacna1c+/- rats, possibly arising due to impairments in schaffer-collateral plasticity. Such deficits may underlie Cacna1c-associated behavioural impairments, highlighting a potential mechanism underlying cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disease.<br/></p>
