        <h1>A Method for Distinguishing Between Feedforward and Feedback Influences on Neural Responses</h1><h2>Samuel Alvernaz</h2><h3>Samuel Alvernaz, University of Rochester; Richard Lange, University of Rochester; Ralf Haefner, University of Rochester;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>This neural activity of sensory neurons is not just the result of external stimuli - what may be thought of as a feedforward drive - but is also influenced by feedback signals reflecting internal variables. Distinguishing between the effects of external and internal influences on neural responses is therefore an important question for neural coding and in particular understanding the nature of response covariability (“noise correlations”). In prior studies, changes in neural covariability between different behavioral contexts were taken as evidence for the influence of feedback signals (Cohen & Newsome 2008, Bondy et al. 2018). Here, we propose a method to estimate the magnitude of task-related feedback without the need for data on a second task, by comparing neural variability in the task-relevant direction with the neural variability in other, equivalent directions in neural population response space. We validate our method using a model of realistic covariability induced by shared feedforward noise based on Kanitscheider et al. (2015). We extend that model by incorporating learnt receptive fields as well as variable feedback whose strength acts as ground truth for validating our method. In addition to a detailed analysis of the resulting correlation structure, we identify failure modes of the proposed method and perform a power analysis to obtain estimates of how much data is needed to reliably distinguish feedback from feedforward sources depending on the strength of the feedback injected.
