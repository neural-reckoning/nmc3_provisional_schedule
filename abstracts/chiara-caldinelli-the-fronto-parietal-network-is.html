        <h1>The Fronto-Parietal Network Is Not a Flexible Hub  During Naturalistic Cognition</h1><h2>Chiara Caldinelli</h2><h3>Rhodri Cusack, Trinity College Dublin</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>It has been argued that the fronto-parietal network (FPN) is a flexible hub, in that it reconfigures its connectivity with other brain regions, to a greater extent than other networks. Cocuzza et al. (2019) and Cole et al. (2013) administered a set of difficult tasks during fMRI and found between-network variability in functional connectivity was larger for the FPN than for ten other networks. A limitation of this study is that the tasks were designed to be difficult and engage the FPN. It is unclear, therefore, whether the FPN is a flexible hub in general, or only in the context of challenging tasks. We therefore tested whether the FPN is a flexible hub during naturalistic cognition. In Experiment 1, we analysed data from 15 people watching a movie, Forrest Gump (www.studyforrest.org). We found that the variability in connectivity of the FPN was no different from other networks, providing no evidence that it acted as a flexible hub. As naturalistic movies do not have a regular block design over which to examine changes in connectivity, we investigated a range of temporal window sizes from 30-240 s. The results generalised across these. However, it is possible that Forrest Gump engaged the FPN less than everyday life, and the dataset only has 15 subjects. In Experiment 2, therefore we analysed a larger dataset (n=647, www.cam-can.org) of people watching a suspenseful clip known to strongly engage the FPN (Naci et al., 2014). Again, we found that the FPN was no more flexible than other networks. These results suggest that during naturalistic cognition, the FPN does not act as a flexible hub any more than other networks in the brain, suggesting it is not a trait of the FPN, but rather just a state during sets of difficult tasks.</p>
