        <h1>DystoniaNet: A Deep Learning Platform to Diagnose Dystonia from Raw Structural MRI</h1><h2>Davide Valeriani</h2><h3>Kristina Simonyan</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Dystonia is a neurological disorder of heterogeneous pathophysiology, which causes involuntary muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and postures. As the third most common movement disorder after essential tremor and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, its diagnosis is remarkably challenging due to the absence of a biomarker or "gold standard" diagnostic test. This leads to a low agreement between clinicians, with up to 50% of cases being misdiagnosed and diagnostic delays extending up to 10.1 years. We developed a deep-learning algorithmic platform, DystoniaNet, to automatically identify and validate a microstructural neural network biomarker for dystonia diagnosis from raw structural brain MRIs of 612 subjects, including 392 patients with three different forms of isolated focal dystonia and 220 healthy controls. DystoniaNet was specifically designed to estimate its uncertainty and refer uncertain cases to further examination. Moreover, its streamlined architecture makes it more computationally efficient than other popular deep learning platform, such as AlexNet. In our dataset, DystoniaNet identified clusters in corpus callosum, anterior and posterior thalamic radiations, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior temporal and superior orbital gyri as the biomarker components. These regions are known to contribute to abnormal inter-hemispheric information transfer, sensorimotor processing, and executive control of motor commands in dystonia pathophysiology. DystoniaNet used this biomarker to achieve an overall accuracy of 98.8% in diagnosing dystonia, referring only 3.5% of cases to further examination. The diagnostic decision by DystoniaNet was computed in 0.36 s per subject. DystoniaNet significantly outperformed shallow machine-learning algorithms in benchmark comparisons, showing nearly a 20% increase in its diagnostic performance. The DystoniaNet platform showed substantial improvement over the current 34% agreement rate on dystonia diagnosis between clinicians. In summary, DystoniaNet leverages deep learning to deliver highly accurate, timely, interpretable, and generalizable dystonia diagnosis, hence contributing to enhance clinical decision-making of this disorder.</p>
