        <h1>Variability and stability of folding patterns across cortical development and evolution</h1><h2>Katja Heuer</h2><h3>Katja Heuer, Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity; Mathieu Santin, Institute for Brain and Spinal Cord; Marc Herbin, National Museum of Natural History; Roberto Toro, Institut Pasteur</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Folding patterns are very characteristic of different species. Most quantification methods focus, however, on the estimation of the degree of folding â€“ the description of their pattern remaining mostly qualitative. We developed a method to generate folding graphs which summarise the folding pattern of an individual brain. We illustrate the application of our method by computing folding graphs for several different mammalian species, as well as throughout their development.<br/>We manually segmented the cerebrum and reconstructed 3D surfaces for all specimens. Based on mean curvature, we built gyral skeletons for each specimen and several developmental stages. The lines in the skeleton represent the axis of each gyrus, providing information about their orientation and width. We then simplify these lines into a graph and represent the folding pattern as an adjacency matrix where each cell corresponds to an encounter point between 2 or more gyri. We finally flatten the gyral skeletons.<br/>Here, we will illustrate the flat skeletons for different primate species and developmental stages for several of the species. The complexity of the folding patterns increases rapidly with increasing brain volume leading to the development of a shared pattern which emerges even across different branches of the phylogenetic tree. Similarly, decreases in brain volume lead to a simplification of the folding pattern which occurs in a similar manner across different branches. A first comparison of folding patterns using graph edit distance leads to a clustering of species which reflects their brain volume more than a clade-specifc pattern.<br/>Fold graphs can become a useful complement to estimations of the degree of folding, and provide a new perspective on the study of phylogenetic diversity.<br/></p>
