        <h1>Paired Stimulation in the Human Limbic System Induced Functional Connectivity Changes Consistent with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity </h1><h2>Jasmine Zhou</h2><h3>Kira Evitts, University of Washington; Samantha Sun, University of Washington; Ankit Khambhati, University of California, San Francisco; Kristin Sellers, University of California, San Francisco; Edward Chang, University of California, San Francisco; Azadeh Yazdan-Shahmorad, Washington National Primate Research Center, University of Washington, and University of California, San Francisco</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Many neurological disorders can be attributed to abnormal neural dynamics at the network level, which arise from anomalous neural connectivity. As a result, spatially and temporally specific brain stimulation protocols can be designed to take advantage of our brainâ€™s natural plasticity, reorganize selected neural connections, and serve as a potential therapy for various brain disorders. One of the proposed mechanisms for inducing targeted functional changes in the brain is spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), which suggests that long-term potentiation (LTP) will be induced in two connected neurons when presynaptic spikes lead postsynaptic spikes by 0 to 20 ms. Although strong evidence of STDP has been found for synapses in vitro, its presence at the network level in awake human brains remains unclear. To investigate the relevance of STDP in humans, we applied paired-pulse electrical stimulation with different time delays, and recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from multiple epilepsy patients using implanted depth and electrocorticography (ECoG) grid electrodes. We assessed the functional connectivity between recorded brain regions in the limbic system as quantified by the coherence between LFPs. Our results showed that both stimulation paradigms significantly altered the functional connectivity between brain regions compared to control. Meanwhile, paired stimulation with 10-ms delay led to greater increase in LFP coherence compared to that with 100-ms delay across multiple frequency bands. These results support the role for an STDP-like process in the emotion processing regions of the human brain.</p>
