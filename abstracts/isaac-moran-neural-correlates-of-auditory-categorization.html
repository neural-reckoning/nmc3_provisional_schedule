        <h1>Neural correlates of auditory categorization in the supplementary motor area</h1><h2>Isaac Morán</h2><h3>Jonathan Melchor, UNAM; Javier Pérez, INR; Tonatiuh Figueroa, UNAM; Luis Lemus, UNAM</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Grouping naturalistic auditory stimuli into discrete categories is fundamental for speech recognition in humans and social communication across various species. It has been noted that supplementary motor area (SMA) is part of a circuit that links auditory information into motor commands. We investigated whether SMA is involved in the processing of the categorization of auditory stimuli. We train nonhuman primates in a task of categorizing naturalistic auditory stimuli. Our results demonstrate that SMA, both at the level of single neurons and at the population level, shows a categorical coding related to both auditory signals as well as the motor choices of the subjects. Our results demonstrate that SMA integrates sensory information and links it to categorical processing.</p>
