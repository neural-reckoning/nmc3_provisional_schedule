        <h1>Potentiation and Sequestration of Lipid Profile and Oxidative Stress in CdCl2 Mediated Neurotoxicity; Two Sides of Palm Oil Fractions</h1><h2>PATRICK ICHIPI-IFUKOR</h2><h3>Samuel Ogheneovo Asagba</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Objective: This study was to determine if pretreatment with palm oil fractions could mitigate against sub-chronic cadmium mediated oxidative stress and lipid profile in the brain.<br/>Design: The experimental study comprised six groups A-F. Rats in group A served as the normal control and received normal feed and water only, group B negative control received CdCl2 only. Test groups (C-F) received 5ml/Kg body weight of appropriate palm oil fractions: Crude Palm oil (CPO), Silica Gel Extract (SGE), Bleached Palm Oil (BPE), and Unsaponifiable Extract (UPE) from day 1-21 respectively. This was followed by sub-chronic exposure to 5mg/kg bodyweight CdCl2 through gavage to rats in groups B-F from day 22-43. Six rats from each group were sacrificed and the brain tissues excised for oxidative stress indices and lipid profile on days 29 and 43 of the experiment.<br/>Results: Findings indicates significant rise of brain lipid peroxidation in experimental groups relative to control. Comparatively, CPO, SGE, and BPE increased brain MDA levels and reduced SOD and catalase enzyme activities compared to those that received only CdClÂ¬2. Sulphite oxidase enzyme was significantly reduced in test groups relative to control. Our study also demonstrated a significant increase in brain GSH in animals that received UPE compared to control. Brain lipid profile showed a significant rise in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, a significant reduction in triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol in CdCl2, CPO, SGE, BPE groups. UPE mediated a reverse in the order of lipid profile observed in other palm oil fractions relative to control.<br/>Conclusion: Palm oil fractions (CPO, SGE, and BPE) pre-administration potentiated brain oxidative stress indices, brain (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol) and reduced HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride in a sub-chronic CdCl2 toxicity. UPE, on the other hand, sequestered brain increase of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol while promoting activities of selected antioxidant defense markers in the brain.<br/></p>
