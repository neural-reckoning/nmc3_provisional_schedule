        <h1>Spinal-Mediated Kappa Opioid Receptor Antinociception is Blunted in a Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis</h1><h2>Caylin Chadwick</h2><h3>Caylin I. Chadwick, Neuroscience & Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta, Canada; Bradley J. Kerr, Anesthesiology & Pain Medicine, University of Alberta, Canada; Anna M.W. Taylor, Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Canada</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease in which inflammation and autoimmune reactions result in demyelination within the central nervous system (CNS). Chronic pain is commonly experienced with MS, and changes in the kappa opioid system have been described in several models of chronic pain. This project aims to characterize changes in kappa opioid receptor (KOR) analgesia and expression in a mouse model of MS.<br/><br/>	To accomplish this, male and female C57Bl/6 mice were induced with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which models the inflammation, autoimmunity, and demyelination that occurs in human MS. At the first sign of disease presentation, systemic injection of KOR agonist U50,488H (1.6 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) evoked equipotent analgesic responses in EAE and control mice. However, local administration of U50,488H into the spinal cord (10 ug, i.t.) was significantly less analgesic in EAE mice. To explore this disparity, KOR mRNA and protein expression was measured in various CNS regions associated with pain using fluorescent in situ hybridization and western blot, respectively. In the spinal cord, KOR mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in EAE mice. No changes were detected in KOR protein levels in the amygdala and the claustrum; however, there was a significant increase in the expression of KOR protein in the nucleus accumbens of EAE mice.<br/><br/>	Overall, this data suggests that systemic KOR agonism is effective at eliciting analgesia in a mouse model of MS. We posit that reductions in KOR expression in the spinal cord are compensated by increases in supraspinal KOR expression to maintain analgesic potential, especially in the nucleus accumbens.</p>
