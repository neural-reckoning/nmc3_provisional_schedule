        <h1>Memory suppression and fear extinction related to emotional cues</h1><h2>Olivia Cook</h2><h3>L. Knight, University of Louisville; B. E. Depue, University of Louisville</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background<br/>Disparate research in animals and humans have shown reduced influence of fearful memory as an automatic process and a volitional process. It’s unclear whether volitional emotional memory suppression largely involves the same neural circuitry as automatic fear extinction.<br/><br/>Objective<br/>To validate an examination of neural associations/dissociations between volitional memory suppression and fear extinction, we behaviorally tested both memory suppression and fear extinction. We aimed to identify what components of the memory are consciously reduced during suppression.<br/><br/>Methods<br/>Participants (N=24) first learned 32 pairs of pictures: neutral human faces with either neutral images (NEU) or fearful scenes (NEG). Next, a neutral face would be shown and participants would be asked to either think about (THINK), suppress (NO THINK), or neither think about nor suppress (EXTINCT) the paired image; some faces weren’t shown (BASELINE). Participants then rated each face on how pleasant or unpleasant it made them feel and were asked to remember if the associated picture was negative or neutral.<br/><br/>Results<br/>Within the ratings, there were significant main effects of Valence (p<.001), Condition (p<.001), and a significant interaction of Condition by Valence (p=.02). Think NEG showed that valence is lower than Baseline NEG (p = .012), while Extinction NEG showed that valence is higher than Baseline (p = .011).<br/>Within the recall, there was a significant interaction of Condition by Valence (p=.02). NEG Think has the highest recall (92.71%) and there is a significant difference between NEG Think and NEG No Think (92.71 vs. 70.83%, p=.001) Additionally, NEG Think is significantly above baseline (p=.006), while NEG No Think is below baseline (although n.s., p=.38).<br/> <br/>Conclusions<br/> Think related to enhancement in memory recall and the most negative ratings of the paired neutral faces. No Think was associated with worsened recall, but valence ratings were right around baseline. Extinction did not alter memory, but valence became less negative.<br/></p>
