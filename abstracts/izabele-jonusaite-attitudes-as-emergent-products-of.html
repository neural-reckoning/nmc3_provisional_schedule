        <h1>Attitudes as Emergent Products of Associative Evaluations, Metacognitive Assessment, and Self-Report: A Computational Approach</h1><h2>Izabelė Jonušaitė</h2><h3>Han van der Maas, Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam; Casper Hesp, Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Attitudinal dynamics have been described by dual-process theorists as having two distinct patterns—implicit and explicit. However, the interaction and blending of the two have been poorly understood. There is empirical and theoretical research on the circumstances under which these processes dissociate and align, yet a principled account of their interaction has not been proposed. In this paper, we present a computational model that formalizes the interaction between implicit and explicit attitudinal dynamics, and generates predictions of experimental explicit attitude measurement data based on these dynamics. We employ the Attitudinal Entropy framework by Dalege et al. (2016, 2018) to simulate implicit attitudes. To incorporate dynamics of explicit attitude formation and report, we expand the model by translating it into Bayesian terms, and use the Active Inference framework (Friston, 2010; Friston et al., 2017) to build a higher-level, (minimally) metacognitive module that assesses the real-time implicit level dynamics, stores memory of past assessments and directs self-report. Bidirectional communication among the modules allows to reproduce a variety of empirical phenomena related to self-report. Firstly, we simulate forced choice self-report for various settings that modulate explicit-implicit interactions, showing attitude strengthening effects under functional metacognition but not when metacognitive assessment is overconfident. Secondly, we simulate what happens on the implicit and explicit attitude levels when a person is forced to give a specific report (e.g., due to social pressure). The model sheds light on cognitive mechanisms underlying self-report and lays a foundation for a computational analysis of heterogeneous cognitive processes that combine to produce emergent attitudinal phenomena.</p>
