Primary and secondary changes show a striking inhomogeneous distribution and severity pattern among patients, raising questions about the underlying mechanisms.  <br/><br/>Aims: This study aims to uncover atrophic changes being present within the cerebellum of RE patients and sets them in relation to atrophy patterns of the cerebral cortex.<br/><br/>Methods: In a cross-sectional manner 57 patients (37 female, mean age=22+/-16y) diagnosed with RE were tested against 57 matched healthy controls. Using a surface-based approach morphometric measures of the cerebral cortex were examined. Depending on the visual appearance of cerebral atrophy, hypothetical groups of predominantly affected regions were formed. Cerebellar atrophy was studied by performing a Voxel-based-Morphometry and related to the groups of different regional cerebral affection.<br/><br/>Results: The cerebral cortex of the ipsilesional hemisphere showed widespread atrophy, particularly located around the sylvian fissure (fwe-corrp<0.01). The VBM of the cerebellum revealed bihemispheric atrophy most pronounced in both cerebellar tonsils and the contralesional posterior lobe (tfce-corrp<0.01). While significant atrophy was observed in patients with occipital, temporal and insular cerebral atrophy focus, patients with a frontal disease focus or a diffuse atrophy distribution did not show significant cerebellar atrophy compared to controls. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Supporting previous studies, atrophy within the ipsilesional cerebral hemisphere showed a transsylvian predilection site. Surprisingly, both cerebellar hemispheres showed significant atrophy, even though the primary pathology is thought to be restricted to one cerebral hemisphere. Crossed cerebellar atrophy might explain degeneration observed on the contralesional cerebellar hemisphere, while excitotoxicity, antiepileptic drugs or even the primary disease might be causes for bilateral neuronal degeneration.<br/></p>
