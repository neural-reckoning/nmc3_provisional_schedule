Recent communication neuroscience research shows a significant relationship between frontal brain regional activity and opinion change. Despite these findings, the neural dynamics that give rise to this relationship and the extent to which these effects extend beyond the laboratory are largely unexplored. Here, we utilize a network science approach -- dynamic community detection -- to extract brain network dynamics, and extend this method to data that mirrors neural activity of digital media consumers today. We investigate the dynamic coactivity of neural correlates of opinion change, as prompted by consumption of online persuasive media. Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was collected from 240 healthy and diverse participants while interacting with biased content in a social media environment. Before and after interacting with the platform, participants were asked their opinions on vaccinations, capital punishment, corporate investment practices and politics. After calculating opinion change scores, we estimated the statistical relationship of the bandpassed EEG data (delta: 1-3Hz, theta: 4-7Hz, alpha: 8-12 Hz, beta: 13-25Hz, gamma: 30-40Hz) between electrodes with a weighted phase-lag index (wPLI). These connectivity matrices were then subjected to the dynamic community detection algorithm to extract network metrics that quantify the propensity of “nodes” (electrodes, here) to change their network affiliation across time.  We show that network flexibility and promiscuity of frontal nodes, specifically within gamma and alpha bands, during engagement with persuasive digital content, are significantly associated with opinion change. These results indicate that coactivation of the frontal brain region with other network communities explains, in part, an individual’s likelihood to alter their position on a sensitive issue. Our results highlight the importance of neural coordination in our decision making process and provide support of the importance of frontal regions in shaping our opinions, not only in the laboratory, but also in a real-world scenario.</p>
