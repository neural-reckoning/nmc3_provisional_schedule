        <h1>Neural Signature of Subjective Confidence in Perceptual Decision Making</h1><h2>Wei Dou</h2><h3>Jason Samaha</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Drift diffusion models propose that decisions are formed by continuously accumulating sensory information. Once the accumulated evidence reaches a boundary, a decision is made. Stronger evidence is accumulated faster and reaches the decision boundary quicker. According to some proposals, confidence in the accuracy of a decision depends on the same accumulated evidence underlying the choice. The central parietal positivity (CPP) component of the human event-related potential (ERP) has been demonstrated to encode accumulated evidence for a decision, like the ramping activity found in the parietal cortex of monkeys during evidence accumulation. As the buildup rate of the CPP indicates how quickly evidence is accumulated, it would be reasonable to expect that the CPP indexes confidence. In this study, we examined how evidence strength influences subjective reports of confidence in observersâ€™ perceptual decisions and how the CPP changes with different levels of evidence strength and confidence. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings were measured while participants (n=25) performed a two-alternative dot-motion discrimination task with six motion coherence levels. Consistent with previous research, we found that the buildup rate of the CPP increased with stronger evidence and faster responses, indicating the build-to-bound dynamic of a decision variable. More interestingly, the buildup rate scaled with the confidence rating on the decision, suggesting that evidence accumulation in the brain (i.e. CPP) is tightly linked to the subjective perceptual experience of the sensory information favoring the decision. Further analysis showed that the response-aligned CPP ramped up faster for higher confidence when holding motion coherence constant. We conclude that, independent of the influence of objective evidence strength, <br/>CPP reflects subjective confidence.<br/></p>
