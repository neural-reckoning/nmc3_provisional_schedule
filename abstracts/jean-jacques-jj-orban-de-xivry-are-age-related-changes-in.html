        <h1>Are age-related changes in internal model function linked to poorer somatosensory function?</h1><h2>Jean-Jacques (JJ) Orban de Xivry</h2><h3>Orban de Xivry JJ, KU Leuven; Vandevoorde K, KU Leuven, Parthasharathy M, KU Leuven</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Motor functions are thought to be decreasing with age. Yet, in two different motor paradigms linked to internal model function, we observed that the performance of the older participants was "better" than that of younger participants. In a force matching task involving the arm, participants were asked to reproduce a force by applying a force with one arm onto the other arm. In this case, the reproduced force is higher in older participants than in younger participants. This overshoot in force is linked to the fact that an internal model predicts the movement of our own arm and hence the intensity of the sensation of the internally-generated force is decreased (Parthasharathy, Mantini and Orban de Xivry, 2020; Wolpe et al. 2016).<br/><br/>Similarly, in the task-irrelevant clamped feedback task (Morehead et al. 2017), participants are asked to bring their invisible hand to a target but the cursor trajectory is deviated on the left or right of the target by a constant angle. That is, the cursor direction is made fully independent from the hand direction while the velocity of hand and cursor are matched. When the perturbation is introduced, implicit motor adaptation occurs because of the introduced sensory prediction error (the difference between the expected and actual cursor direction). As a result, the hand direction drifts opposite to the cursor unbeknownst to the participant. This drift is larger in older participants (Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry, 2019). <br/><br/>In both cases, the increased response from older participants could be linked to their age-related deficits in somatosensory function. In the force-matching task, the overshoot in force is thought to be the result of the balance between sensory information and internal model output. Given the accepted age-related deficits in somatosensory function (e.g. proprioception), the large overshoot in older people might be due to their poorer somatosensory function. In the motor adaptation task, proprioception would ensure that the hand does not drift too far away from where the participants think the hand is going.<br/><br/>Yet, across several experiments with both tasks, we failed to find any link between somatosensory function and the performance in the force-matching task (Parthasharathy, Mantini and Orban de Xivry, 2020) or the motor adaptation tasks (Vandevoorde and Orban de Xivry, in preparation). This interactive presentation will be centered on the discussion of why elderly participans are "better" at these tasks.<br/></p>
