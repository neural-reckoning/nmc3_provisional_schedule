        <h1>Investigation of postsubicular head direction cells in the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimer’s disease</h1><h2>Laura Berkowitz</h2><h3>Laura E. Berkowitz, University of New Mexico; Ryan H. Harvey, University of New Mexico; Maria Gabaldon-Parish, University of New Mexico; Victoria J. Roy, University of New Mexico; and Benjamin J. Clark, University of New Mexico;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Spatial navigation and memory are impaired in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are prominent behavioral markers of preclinical AD. The TgF344-AD rat model of AD exhibits similar behavioral and pathological features to humans and thus serves as an excellent model to investigate mechanisms underlying spatial impairment in AD. Previously, we found that 10-month-old TgF344-AD rats make progressively less spatially precise movements during a reference memory variant of the Morris water maze. TgF344-AD rats also exhibit progressive pathology in cortical areas involved in the coding of head direction. Thus, this study sought to characterize head direction (HD) cells in the postsubiculum, a prominent HD cell loci, in 15 - 19 month female TgF344-AD rats and aged matched F344 controls. Rats performed a pellet chasing task within a cylinder fitted with a white cue card during recordings. In some sessions, the cue card was rotated to assess landmark control. HD cells from TgF344-AD rats exhibited increased peak firing rates, but maintained directional firing characteristics similar to that of controls. Additionally, responses to the cue card rotation were similar to that of controls, but with greater variability. These results will be discussed in relation to the hypothesis that head direction cell dysfunction contributes to spatial impairment in Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
