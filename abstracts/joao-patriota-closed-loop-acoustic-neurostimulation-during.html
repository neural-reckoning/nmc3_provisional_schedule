        <h1>Closed-Loop Acoustic Neurostimulation during Sleep: Targeting theta waves</h1><h2>João  Patriota</h2><h3>João Patriota ; Elsa Juan; Illia Korjoukov; Umberto Olcese; Lucia Talamini</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recently there has been an increasing interest in the potential applications of closed loop neuro-stimulation. Most studies are focused on targeting slow waves during NREM sleep, to improve memory consolidation. REM sleep plays a crucial role in emotional processing, which is essential for mental health. Theta is a hallmark of REM sleep, therefore detecting and manipulating theta waves could pave the way towards targeted interventions in clinical and sub-clinical populations. We present the first results on the development of an algorithm able to detect and target precise phases of theta (4-8 Hz), which could be used to further address how targeting can play a role on memory reactivation and memory consolidation.<br/>Data of nine participants that underwent a night of polysomnography and EEG recordings in the lab. Ten minutes of recorded REM epochs from each subject were used to run the closed-loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) system, targeting the 0-degree phase of theta.<br/>   Targeting procedure involves an oscillatory phase prediction algorithm, based on non-linear sine fitting on the most recent data segment of unfiltered EEG signal. The criteria for stimulus release are: 1) The fitted sine is in a frequency range of interest, 2) The fitting error is below a given threshold & 3) The prediction is within a delimited future time window. The algorithm is implemented within EventIDE software (Okazolab). This method has been applied to the slow oscillation frequency range.<br/>   Across all participants we achieved a mean target phase of 10.85 degrees (3.58 median), standard deviation of 56.74 degrees and made, on average, 163.78 predictions for each separate REM epoch. <br/><br/>   These results on offline simulations suggest that it is possible to target specific phases of theta oscillations in a closed loop setup. This brings possibilities of a different tool for non-invasive intervention on processes that happen during sleep. </p>
