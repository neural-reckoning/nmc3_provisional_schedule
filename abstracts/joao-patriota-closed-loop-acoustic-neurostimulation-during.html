        <h1>Closed-Loop Acoustic Neurostimulation during Sleep: Targeting theta waves</h1><h2>João  Patriota</h2><h3>João Patriota ; Elsa Juan; Illia Korjoukov; Umberto Olcese; Lucia Talamini</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recently there has been an increasing interest in the potential applications of closed loop neuro-stimulation. Most studies are focused on targeting slow waves during NREM sleep, to improve memory consolidation. REM sleep plays a crucial role in emotional processing, which is essential for mental health. Theta is a hallmark of REM sleep, therefore detecting and manipulating theta waves could pave the way towards targeted interventions in clinical and sub-clinical populations. We present the first results on the development of an algorithm able to detect and target precise phases of theta (4-8 Hz), which could be used to further address how targeting can play a role on memory reactivation and memory consolidation.
Data of nine participants that underwent a night of polysomnography and EEG recordings in the lab. Ten minutes of recorded REM epochs from each subject were used to run the closed-loop acoustic stimulation (CLAS) system, targeting the 0-degree phase of theta.
   Targeting procedure involves an oscillatory phase prediction algorithm, based on non-linear sine fitting on the most recent data segment of unfiltered EEG signal. The criteria for stimulus release are: 1) The fitted sine is in a frequency range of interest, 2) The fitting error is below a given threshold & 3) The prediction is within a delimited future time window. The algorithm is implemented within EventIDE software (Okazolab). This method has been applied to the slow oscillation frequency range.
   Across all participants we achieved a mean target phase of 10.85 degrees (3.58 median), standard deviation of 56.74 degrees and made, on average, 163.78 predictions for each separate REM epoch. 

   These results on offline simulations suggest that it is possible to target specific phases of theta oscillations in a closed loop setup. This brings possibilities of a different tool for non-invasive intervention on processes that happen during sleep. </p>
