        <h1>Flexibility and Predictions in Autism: Findings from EEG, behavior, and machine learning classification</h1><h2>Seydanur Tikir</h2><h3>Seydanur Tikir, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America; Michael J. Crosse, X, the Moonshot Factory, Mountain View, CA, United States of America; Dylan Festa, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America; Jonathan Vacher, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America; Ruben Coen-Cagli, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America; Sophie Molholm, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, United States of America;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In stable and predictable environments, the brain generates expectations with high confidence, whereas in unstable environments, this confidence is lowered. Thus, the brain not only makes predictions, but also assigns an expected error rate based on environmental statistics. Individuals with autism resist even trivial changes in everyday life, which is a major phenotype of autism. We hypothesize that their ability to flexibly tune the confidence of their predictions based on changes in the stimulus statistics is impaired. To assess the use of environmental statistics in updating predictions, adults with (N=21) and without (N=20) autism performed a task in which they responded to the completion of a pattern of three sequentially presented shapes. Across blocks of ~120 pattern initiations, the probability of pattern completion varied between 100%, 86%, 66%, and 33%. The ability to infer a change in the probability of pattern completion was assessed with reaction time and high-density electroencephalography (EEG), with a particular focus on CNV and P300 components in the analyses of evoked brain potentials. The modulation of P300 and CNV as a function of stimulus probability was significantly diminished in the autism group. Further, a linear classifier trained to discriminate between individuals with autism and controls based on average brain responses to target trials (at all electrodes and time points) revealed successful classification (~80% accuracy) when all probability conditions are given as input. We also presented a passive auditory oddball paradigm in which the probability of deviant tones was 4%, 8%, or 16% in different blocks. Preliminary analyses of the mismatch negativity (MMN) component suggest that the brain is able to preattentively calculate stimulus statistics in autism. Taken together, these data might indicate that the specific problem with predictive processing in autism is not in registering environmental statistics, but in applying the statistics to making predictions.</p>
