        <h1>Reward-specific activation  in prefrontal cortex  during a gambling task</h1><h2>Angela Hwang</h2><h3>Thomas Karner;Karim El Salim;Ecem Aydin</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Numerous neuroimaging studies have investigated that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) are strongly implicated in higher-order cognitive functions, such as decision making and reward processing. In 2013, Human Connectome Project (HCP) (Barch et al.) measured the functional connectivity of healthy adult human brains during cognitive, emotion, motor, and sensory processing-related tasks via task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI). Using the HCP dataset, we investigated the brain activation differences in OFC and vmPFC during the gambling task. We found a strong correlation between the magnitude of brain activation and gambling condition (win and loss). In line with past studies, this finding shows the involvement of the prefrontal reward area in reward processing. These findings may have implications for understanding the process of addiction such as pathological gambling.</p>
