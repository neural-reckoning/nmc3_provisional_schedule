        <h1>Discrete and continuous dynamics of neural state space during decision making</h1><h2>Jun Ye</h2><h3>Sunandha Srikanth, Department of Biological Sciences, Institution: University of California, San Diego;  Tanvi Ranjan, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard University; Frances S. Cho, Dept. of Neurology, University of California San Francisco; Jun Ye, NMA</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Perceptual decision-making tasks involve transforming continuous sensory inputs into discrete decisions and continuous actions (Parr & Friston, 2018). This transformation occurs across a large network of brain areas. In mice performing such a task, neurons encoding choice are localized in forebrain and midbrain regions, while neurons encoding action initiation are distributed across the brain (Steinmetz et al. 2019). Whether the representation of brain-wide neural activity during such a transformation evolves in a continuous or discrete manner remains unclear (VanRullen & Koch, 2003). Hidden Markov models (HMM) can be used to assess neural dynamics when latent neural states are assumed to be discrete. Here, we compare this approach with that describing smooth evolution of states by decoding behavior following either HMM, or independent component analysis (ICA) using data collected by Steinmetz et al (2019).<br/>Discrete state representation via HMM had similar decoding accuracy when decoding visual stimulus (present or not) compared to that obtained via continuous state via ICA. In contrast, continuous representation yielded greater accuracy in decoding action (go vs no-go) compared to discretized state reduction. Across sessions, discretized states mapped onto different behavioral epochs, potentially due to differences in the brain regions sampled, how individual mice approach the task, or between-day variability of a given mouse. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) to refine the discrete state representation in light of this variability. Coupling of neural spiking rate to behavior was used as a proxy for neuronsâ€™ contribution to behavior. We use insights from the GLM to refine the comparison of discrete and continuous models for decoding behavior. These results suggest a quick/almost instant change in neural dynamics in response to visual stimulus and a slow changing dynamics, when leading to action. <br/></p>
