Experimental evidence in animal models and the study of other human pathologies have demonstrated the role of the hippocampus in PS, in particular of the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3. Patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (mTLE-HE) commonly report mnemonic deficits that have been associated with failures in PS. However, the link between these impairments and the integrity of the hippocampal subfields in these patients has not yet been determined. The aim of this project is to explore the association between the ability to perform mnemonic functions and the integrity of hippocampal CA1, CA3, DG in patients with unilateral mTLE-HE. To reach this goal we evaluated the memory of the patients with an improved object mnemonic similarity test. We then analyzed the hippocampal complex integrity with structural and microstructural diffusion data from high resolution 3T MRI. Our data indicate that patients with unilateral mTLE-HE present more difficulties in the mnemonic discrimination test that target PS, especially in conditions with higher interference. These specific mnemonic deficits would correlate with the integrity of white matter tracts in the subregions DG and CA3 contralateral to the seizure focus and therefore to the main sclerotic damage.</p>
