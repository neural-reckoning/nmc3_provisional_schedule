        <h1>The Nuclear GAPDH-HMGB cascade in cortical microglia regulates cognitive flexibility</h1><h2>Adriana Ramos</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key enzyme in glycolysis. Beyond its fundamental role in metabolism, GAPDH can get post-translationally modified in response to cellular stressors and subsequently translocate to nuclei to exert transcriptional control [the nuclear GAPDH (N-GAPDH) cascade]. We hypothesized that this cascade might play a critical role linking stress and behavior.

In this study, we discovered a novel mechanism that controls the response of microglia to stress through the N-GAPDH cascade and regulates animal adaptive behavior. Specifically, activation of the N-GAPDH cascade solely in cortical microglia and cognitive inflexibility were observed in a Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse model. Such cognitive deficits were blocked through pharmacological treatment or microglia-specific genetic intervention targeting the initial steps of the N-GAPDH cascade. To understand how the N-GAPDH cascade in microglia causes the cognitive deficits, we performed a ChIP-Seq analysis against N-GAPDH using ex-vivo microglia from the LPS-treated mice. We found upregulation of High-mobility group-box (HMGB) that can be secreted from microglia and binds to N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on glutamatergic neurons, causing their hyperactivation which turns to cognitive deficits. In summary, this study defined a new mechanism of microglia-neuron interaction though which stress-activated immune cells regulates neural system via a key metabolic molecule, GAPDH. 

On-going studies: The ChIP-Seq analysis further revealed that the N-GAPDH cascade transcriptionally regulated the expression of GAPDH by itself and controlled proteostasis in microglia in a cell autonomous manner. The relevance of the N-GAPDH cascade in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (in particular monocytes) is under study in order to find possible molecular based biomarkers to predict behavioral inflexibility in the clinic. Among those candidates, we found autofluorescence reflects the activation of the N-GAPDH cascade in preclinical studies. Using a cohort of patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls we found cellular autofluorescence in blood cells negatively correlates with behavioral flexibility.
