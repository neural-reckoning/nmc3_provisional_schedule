        <h1>Flexible modulation of navigational processing in association cortices as a function of task context</h1><h2>Andrew Alexander</h2><h3>A.S. Alexander; J.C. Tung; L.E. Shelley; A.M. Conner; G.W. Chapman; M.E. Hasselmo; D.A. Nitz;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Animals engage in a variety of navigational behaviors that require different regimes of behavioral control and different temporal scales of predictive coding. In the wild, rats readily switch between foraging and more complex behaviors such as chase, wherein they pursue other rats or small prey (Calhoun, 1963). These behaviors require vastly different tracking of multiple behaviorally-significant variables including self-motion state. It is unknown whether changes in behavioral context flexibly modulate the encoding of these variables. To explore this possibility, we compared self-motion processing in multisensory association cortices while rats performed alternating blocks of free foraging and visual target pursuit. Rats learned the pursuit task and demonstrated predictive processing by anticipating target trajectories and intercepting them. Relative to free exploration, pursuit sessions yielded greater proportions of parietal and retrosplenial cortex neurons with reliable sensitivity to self-motion. Pursuit self-motion correlates possessed enhanced signal-to-noise ratios, as a consequence of multiplicative gain modulation, which led to greater decoding accuracy of self-motion state over extended temporal windows of behavior. Finally, many self-motion sensitive neurons conjunctively tracked the position of the visual target relative to the animal in egocentric coordinates providing a potential mechanism for the observed gain changes to self-motion signals. We conclude that association cortex ensembles multiplex navigation-relevant variables in a dynamic manner to enhance behaviorally-relevant  computations as a consequence of task demands.</p>
