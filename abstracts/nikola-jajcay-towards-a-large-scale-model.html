        <h1>Towards a large-scale model of sleeping brain: sleep spindles in network mass models</h1><h2>Nikola Jajcay</h2><h3>Nikola Jajcay, TU Berlin, Institute of Computer Science, CAS, Prague; Klaus Obermayer, TU Berlin, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The hierarchical nesting of sleep spindles and slow oscillations is considered a precursor of successful episodic memory consolidation where it, presumably, sets the stage for memory traces migration from short-term hippocampal storage to longer-lasting neocortical sites. Here we take the first steps towards integrating thalamocortical projections into a large-scale brain model and modelling whole-brain cortical slow-wave activity and thalamic spindles as seen in non-REM sleep. We model the thalamus as a node containing one excitatory and one inhibitory mass representing thalamocortical relay neurons and thalamic reticular nuclei, respectively. We found dynamically interesting spindle-promoting regimes and we were also able to control the inter-spindle interval, spindle duration, and shape of spindle envelope. Secondly, we connected the thalamic node to one cortical node, modelled as excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuronal masses. The excitatory mass contains a spike-triggered adaptation mechanism and is parametrised to sit in the limit cycle generating slow oscillations. Moreover, the cortical node is adapted to include perturbation via transcranial current stimulation. Our results when investigating the dynamical repertoire show that, upon connection, the thalamic spindles are imprinted into cortical node activity where they modulate slow oscillation envelope, and that slow oscillation activity of the cortex, in turn, shapes spindling behaviour of thalamocortical relay mass by affecting spindle duration and inter-spindle interval. Our connected model also conserves the phase-phase and phase-amplitude couplings reported in the literature on observed EEG data. Our results suggest that thalamic mass model of spindle activity can be connected to various mass or mean-field models of cortical nodes and, after careful treatment of network connections and delays, we believe that our conclusions would carry over to the large-scale network model.</p>
