        <h1>Disrupted Organelle Dynamics in Autophago-lysosomal Pathway in the Drosophila Models of C9-ALS In Vivo</h1><h2>Hyun Sung</h2><h3>Thomas E. Lloyd, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by preferential death of motor neurons leading to muscle weakness and atrophy. Although the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, a G4C2 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in C9orf72 is the most common inherited cause of ALS (C9-ALS). Since ALS displays selective vulnerability of motor neurons with cytoplasmic protein accumulation, we hypothesize that changes in intracellular organelle dynamics relevant to protein degradation pathway by G4C2 HRE may be a critical factor in C9-ALS motor neuronal degeneration. Here, we imaged Drosophila motor neurons expressing 30 G4C2 repeats (30R), and investigated the axonal transport of multiple organelles and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) dynamics. We found that 30R expression reduces the number of axonal autophagosomes (APs), while it causes local accumulation of late endosomes (LEs) and lysosomes in motor axons. Interestingly, 30R expression led to a marked reduction in AP number within motor neuron synaptic boutons, and this deficit was not restored by neuronal excitation with TrpA1. However, the remaining APs in C9-ALS motor neurons underwent normal maturation and development to amphisomes upon successful fusion with LEs during their secure retrograde transport. Since axonal transport of mitochondria was not affected by 30R expression, we hypothesized that the impaired axonal transport specific to the auto-lysosomal pathway is not because of global disruption in axonal transport. Instead, we found the converted ER structure and impaired ER dynamics in 30R motor neurons by showing rigid ER knots and ER tubule discontinuities. Collectively, our results indicate that pathogenic repeats of G4C2 hexanucleotide impair auto-lysosomal pathway by affecting intracellular organelle dynamics, and suggest an important role of ER integrity in axonal transport relevant to auto-lysosomal function for neuronal proteostasis.</p>
