        <h1>The effects of wearing an Eye Mask on cognitive functions and sleep architecture</h1><h2>Viviana Greco</h2><h3>Greco Viviana, Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre; Andrews Ralph, University of Sussex, Brighton; Smith Elena, University of Cologne, Germany; Bergamo Damiana, University of Padua, Italy; Cuccio Paola, University of Padua, Italy; Lewis Penelope, Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Study Objectives: In this study, we aimed to explore whether wearing an eye mask while sleeping, therefore minimizing light exposure, would affect the quality and the macrostructure of sleep, and improve cognitive performance. <br/>Methods: Ninety-five healthy participants were tested in a within-subject design. In counterbalanced order, ambient light was blocked during sleep with an eye mask for one week during the summer months (experimental condition) or not-blocked (control condition). After five habituation nights, participants were tested on three cognitive tasks: word pairs memory, Psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and motor-skill learning (MSL) on two consecutive days. Overnight consolidation was also examined on word pairs and MSL. <br/>On the last testing days of both weeks, participant wore a wearable EEG devise in order to measure sleep architecture. <br/>Results: Our analysis revealed superior word pairs encoding in the blocked light condition (p= 0.024). We also found faster performance on the second day of PVT in the blocked light condition (p= 0.002). The eye mask didnâ€™t provide a better performance on MSL (Blocked-light: p< 0.001 vs. No blocked-light: p< 0.001) or overnight consolidation of word pairs (p=0.363). <br/>The blocking light exposure increased the percentage of time spent in NREM stage 2 (p=0.023) and REM sleep (p=0.025). <br/>Conclusion: We conclude that wearing an eye mask during the summer do not only contributes to optimize learning ability and vigilance, but also provides beneficial effect in terms on sleep quality and sleep architecture. No effect was found on motor performance on a finger-tapping task. <br/></p>
