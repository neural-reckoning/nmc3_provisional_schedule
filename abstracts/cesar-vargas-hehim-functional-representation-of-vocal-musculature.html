        <h1>Functional Representation of Vocal Musculature in the Motor Cortex of Mice</h1><h2>César Vargas (he/him)</h2><h3>Elena Waidmann, The Rockefeller University; Erich D. Jarvis, The Rockefeller University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Vocalizations are a dynamic and complex behavior that can be innate or learned. Vocal learners, animals that learn to imitate or modify vocalizations, use top-down input from the forebrain to provide fine motor control over vocal musculature. These forebrain circuits coordinate sub-cortical networks during, and after, learning to precisely execute these learned behaviors. Currently, we do not have genetically tractable mammalian models for speech and vocal learning.  However, behavioral and anatomical findings from our lab and others’ have shown that the ultrasonic song system of mice exhibits rudimentary features consistent with advanced features of vocal learners, including multisyllabic structure that varies with social context, and a small pool of cortical neurons in posteromedial M1 that projects directly to vocal motor neurons in the brainstem. To test if these M1 neurons can functionally activate vocal muscles, and possibly provide fine motor coordination, we used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) paired with electromyography (EMG) from vocal muscles in the larynx of anesthetized mice. We use latency from stimulation to EMG response to estimate the number of synapses between the cortex and the muscles, with shorter latencies meaning there are fewer neurons in the circuit (i.e. more direct connectivity). Using this approach, we found a representation of laryngeal musculature in posteromedial M1, consistent with our anatomical tracing, but also a second representation in anterolateral M1. The two regions have distinct latency and stimulation thresholds from one another. The anterolateral region, corresponding to orofacial motor cortex (OFC), has shorter latencies-to-response from stimulation and lower current injection thresholds. Conversely, the posteromedial region has longer latencies and higher thresholds. These two representations possibly underlie different functions of the laryngeal musculature in different behaviors, such as voluntary swallowing, breathing, or vocalizing. These results are the first characterization of the functional representations of laryngeal musculature in the rodent motor cortex.</p>
