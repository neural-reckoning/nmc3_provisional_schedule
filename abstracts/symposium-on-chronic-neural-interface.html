        <h1>Symposium on Chronic Neural Interface Technology</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>This symposium will feature three leading neural interface engineers that are creating next generation microelectrode array technologies for large-scale and long-term neural recording and stimulation in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve.  Although metal microelectrodes are perhaps the oldest neural interface technology, they remain the most commonly used tool for measuring and stimulating neural activity in the brain, especially in applications that require realtime processing and control, such as brain-machine interfaces. Due to recent advances in materials and microfabrication methods, modern microelectrodes retain the same basic functionality of traditional microelectrodes but with several important new features, including ultrathin and compliant substrates that lead to reduced tissue damage and improved chronic stability. These devices provide hundreds of discrete channels for interfacing with the brain for long time spans, enabling new research paradigms for studying neural circuit function and creating promising new treatments for neurological disorders.
