        <h1>Mind-body relationships and neuroscientific frameworks: a pluralistic proposal based on cultural anthropology</h1><h2>Kamilya Salibayeva</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Mind/body dualism — or the question of the mind’s origins — is a problem central to the development of Western cognitive science. Can the mind be disentangled from the physical entity which exists in the time and space continuum that is associated with mental phenomena? The majority of Western thinkers have operated within this framework of discreteness and separability of notions related to the mind itself. <br/>However, there is an alternative approach to the mind-body problem, based in the worldview of nomadic civilizations of Eurasia. A relatively unknown framework of thought is characteristic for people who practice transhumance — a type of pastoralist livestock herding in Eurasia. Transhumance remains well-preserved in the knowledge and language of ethnic groups of the region. Namely, it has an innate linguistic intractability: there is no separation of abstract notions (e.g., “mind” uses the same word as “consciousness”, “advice”, “memory”).  <br/>In my argument, I will refer to the historical discourse of censorship and colonialism, which hindered the spread and, perhaps, even the possibility of conceptualization of the nomadic world view. As such, I will briefly explore the syncretic relationships between Tengrism, Islam, and other frameworks of cosmological thought which, along with the nature of the nomadic lifestyle, inform the details of the cognitive framework. <br/>After introducing the elements of nomadic civilization, I will provide a brief comparative analysis of the main Western schools of thought using the nomadic “structureless” frame of mind. Concise, yet informative, juxtapositions of views enable the differences to be seen in terms more closely approximated to the Western images of dualistic entities. Thus, my analysis provides a basis for traditionally omitted paradigms of philosophy, and may give rise to a new system of categorization of philosophical notions. </p>
