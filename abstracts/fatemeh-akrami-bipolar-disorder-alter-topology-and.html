        <h1>Bipolar disorder alter topology and synchronizability of functional brain network</h1><h2>Fatemeh Akrami</h2><h3>Fatemeh Akrami, Iran University of Medical Science, Tehran, Iran, Iranian NeuroWave Lab, Isfahan, Iran;  Amirhossein Ghaderi,department of psychology, University of Calgary, Canada ,Iranian NeuroWave Lab, Isfahan, Iran </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Bipolar disorders (BD) is characterized by different functional changing in the brain. It adversely affect human behaviour, speech, and cognition. Furthermore, due to this disorders, people tend to make a decisions which may lead to negative consequences. The question then arises is what does happen in the brain in BD condition? Since the brain is known as a synchronized dynamic network, it is possible that any abnormality changes this synchronizability. In this study, we apply graph theory analysis to compare the organization of the functional brain networks between BD and normal control individual. The participants in this study consists of twenty- one individuals in BD conditions and the same number in the normal group. We tested the brains rhythms (derived from source localized EEG data) in the resting- state eye open (rsEO) condition. Graph theory analysis reveal that there are significant differences in theta wavelength in clustering coefficient (p=0.05; mean (BD)= 0.1283, SD= 0.0625; mean (control)= 0.0944, Std= 0.0526), global efficiency (p=0.04; mean (BD)= 0.1511, Std= 0.0645; mean (control)= 0.1140, Std= 0.0567), and second smallest eigen value (p=0.04; mean (BD)= -2.5115, Std= 1.0928; mean (control)= -1.9448, Std=  0.7094) between two groups. These results indicate that BD alter topology and synchronizability of functional brain network, particularly in theta wavelength. </p>
