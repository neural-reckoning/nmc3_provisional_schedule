        <h1>The impact of advanced age on Mu Opioid Receptor signaling in the midbrain periaqueductal gray: implications on analgesia</h1><h2>Evan Fullerton</h2><h3>Evan F. Fullerton*; Myurajan Rubaharan; Mary C. Karom; Anne Z. Murphy, PhD</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Chronic pain is exceedingly prevalent in individuals over 65 years of age, but is under-managed in this population. The present studies investigated the impact of advanced age on morphine modulation of persistent inflammatory pain in male and female rats. The impact of age, sex, and pain on Î¼-opioid receptor (MOR) expression and binding in the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG), a critical region in the modulation of pain, was examined using immunohistochemistry and receptor autoradiography. Additionally, we used radioligand binding assays and GTPyS assays to assess the impact of age, sex, and pain on MOR availability and affinity, and MOR induced G-protein activation. Intraplantar administration of Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) induced comparable levels of edema and hyperalgesia in adult (2-3mos) and aged (16-18mos) male and female rats. Morphine potency was highest in adult males, with a two-fold decrease in morphine effective concentration (EC50) observed in aged versus adult males (10.22mg/kg versus 5.19mg/kg). Adult and aged female rats also exhibited significantly higher EC50 values (10.69 mg/kg and 9.00 mg/kg, respectively) compared to adult males. The upward shift in EC50 from adult to aged males was paralleled by a reduction in vlPAG MOR expression and binding. Further, females and aged males exhibited reduced vlPAG MOR binding potential (radioligand binding assay) and reduced G-protein activation efficiency (GTPyS assay) compared to adult males. The observed age-related reductions in morphine potency, vlPAG MOR expression, MOR agonist binding, and opioid induced G-protein activation have significant implications in pain management in the aged population. Our novel findings elucidate the mechanisms responsible for reduced morphine potency in aged animals and identify potential therapeutic targets to improve pain management in the elderly.</p>
