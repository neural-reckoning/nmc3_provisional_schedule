        <h1>Analyzing Network Connectivity in Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with MRI</h1><h2>Casey Weiner</h2><h3>Dr. Sarah Nelson, Johns Hopkins Hospital; Dr. Robert Stevens, Johns Hopkins Hospital</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (aSAH) is a life-threatening form of stroke wherein an aneurysm ruptures, causing bleeding into the subarachnoid space, and for which prognosis is still difficult to predict. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide rich data on anatomical and physiological processes in the brain. In our project, we aim to compare the structural and functional connectomes of aSAH patients, generated from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), respectively, with those of healthy controls. We hypothesize that structural and functional connectivity, including networks that are necessary for consciousness and other critical processes of the brain, are altered in patients as compared to controls. Further, we hope to show that our DTI and fMRI data improve prognostication in aSAH.</p>
