        <h1>Chronic Recording from Multiple Hippocampal Sub-Regions in Free Moving Rats with a Flexible Parylene-Based Multi-Electrodes Array</h1><h2>Huijing Xu</h2><h3>Ahuva Hirschberg, USC; Wenxuan Jiang, USC; Kee Scholten, USC; Xuechun Wang, USC; Ellis Meng, USC; Dong Song, USC</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Hippocampus is a subcortical brain structure that is essential for the formation of long-term memories. Obtaining stable, chronic recording of unitary activities from multiple sub-regions of the hippocampus in behaving animals is crucial for studying the biological basis of memoryformation and is also the foundation for developinghippocampal memory prosthesis. However, severe immune response caused by micro-motion between stiff implants and brain tissue often limits the lifetime of penetrating neural probes. To reduce the stiffness mismatch between recording devices and brain tissue, we developed and tested a flexible, Parylene-based multi-electrode array for recording from multiple sub-regions of the rat hippocampus and used this array to collect chronic neural activities from free moving rats. The 64 channels, Parylene multi-electrode array has eight shanks arranged in series with 250μmspacing. On each shank, eight recording electrodes were divided into two groups targeting at the CA3 and the CA1 sub-regions, respectively. The layout of recording sites is specially designed to conformto the curvature of the hippocampal cell body layers.Stereotactic surgery is conducted to chronically implant the flexible array. A dissolvable brace that temporarily reduces effective probe length is used to insert the bare array without buckling.Signals were monitored during the insertion and after recovery, while the animal is exploring freely in an open field. Eleven animals were implanted with the Parylene array. 70 out of 78(90%) implanted functional shanks recorded from at least one sub-region and 50% shanks recorded spike activities from both the CA1 and the CA3 sub-regionsduring the implantation. Insevenanimals, neural activities were monitored immediately post-implantation and on average 70.1±15.8 (23.9±14.2 CA1 and 46.3±13.0 CA3) units were identified from individual animals. After recovery, 90 units (11.3±3.1 per animal) with SNR greater than threewere recorded from eight animals over durationsranging fromthree weeks to eleven months. One Parylene array has recorded stable unitary activities for over 11 months.</p>
