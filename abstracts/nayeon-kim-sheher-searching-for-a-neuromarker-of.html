        <h1>Searching for a neuromarker of spatial attention bias in school-aged children</h1><h2>NaYeon Kim (she/her)</h2><h3>Patricia Hoyos, Princeton University; Sabine Kastner, Princeton University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Visuo-spatial attention is a fundamental cognitive function that enables us to navigate visual environments efficiently. We recently found that children at ages 6-8 exhibit a preference for the left-hand side of space over the right-hand side when allocating attention. Such leftward attention biases in children gradually diminished with increasing age (manuscript under review). In adults, a subject’s spatial bias indicates an asymmetry in attentional weights generated within the dorsal fronto-parietal attention network (also known as Dorsal Attention Network) to direct attention to the contralateral side (Szczepanski & Kastner, 2013). Thus, leftward biases in children may indicate a hemispheric asymmetry in the developing attention network, which gradually achieves a more balanced control of spatial attention as a function of age. To explore this possibility, we first searched for a neuromarker of attention biases in children by building a functional connectivity-based predictive model (Shen et al., 2017) with a priori regions of interest. We measured spatial biases using a landmark task in school-aged children (age 6-12; N = 37) and collected functional MRI data while children were watching a short movie clip. We identified topographic areas in the frontal and parietal cortices by using a probabilistic atlas (Wang et al., 2015), such as Frontal Eye Fields (FEF) and subregions along the Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS). We were able to build a model that successfully predicted each child’s spatial bias from connectivity patterns across the fronto-parietal areas. Using a whole-brain parcellation scheme (Schaefer et al., 2018), we found that spatial biases were predicted specifically from this attention network, but not from other networks. Future work using this predictive modeling approach to examine the development of the attention network will be discussed. Our study provides a lens to better understand the link between attention behavior and the fronto-parietal attention network in typical and atypical development.</p>
