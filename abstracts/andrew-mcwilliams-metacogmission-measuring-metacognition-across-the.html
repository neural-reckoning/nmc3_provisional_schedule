        <h1>“Metacogmission”: measuring metacognition across the lifespan and over two cognitive domains via an engaging gamified task</h1><h2>Andrew McWilliams</h2><h3>Hannah Bibby, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK; Nikolaus Steinbeis, Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK; Stephen M. Fleming, Metacognition Group, Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging and Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, London, UK.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background:
Metacognition – or “thinking about your own thinking” – is of increasing interest to cognitive neuroscientists, as a concept with translational potential to real world problems including theories of mental illness, insight into mental health and the capacity for authentic decision-making. Open questions remain about how metacognition develops and functions. There is conflicting evidence about whether metacognition improves or decays with age, and whether it generalises across multiple cognitive domains. Measurement of metacognition has often been limited by confounding effects of an individual’s task performance levels and of their general propensity to be self-confident. Models derived from Type 2 signal-detection theory circumvent these issues by returning a metacognitive “efficiency” parameter, quantifying sensitivity of confidence ratings given a certain level of task performance. However, fitting these models requires high numbers of trials to generate robust parameters, making tasks difficult to use for people who have low concentration or motivation.

Methods:
Working with a technology firm and a mental health service user advisory group, we developed Metacogmission – a gamified metacognitive task. After trialling at 2 public engagement events with over 400 people, we here report a cross-sectional observational study of >300 online volunteers (18 to 83 years), measuring metacognition for memory and visual perception. We use Bayesian modelling to derive metacognitive efficiency (meta-d’/d’), charting metacognition through the lifespan across two domains. 

Results and conclusions:
Metacogmission was acceptable and fun, showing potential for use with clinical groups. Meta-d’ model fits, as assessed with MCMC convergence diagnostics, were robust, returning parameters comparable to those from more extensive laboratory tasks. Preliminary results indicate that as people age, performance on the first order cognitive tasks was preserved, although raw confidence (“bias”) decreased to middle age. Metacognitive efficiency remained largely stable with age, and was correlated across cognitive domains, consistent with a degree of domain-generality for metacognition. </p>
