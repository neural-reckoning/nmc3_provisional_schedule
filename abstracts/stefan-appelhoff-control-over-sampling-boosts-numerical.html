        <h1>Control over sampling boosts numerical evidence processing in decisions from experience</h1><h2>Stefan Appelhoff</h2><h3> Ralph Hertwig, Max Planck Institute for Human Development; Bernhard Spitzer, Max Planck Institute for Human Development</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Humans routinely sample information about alternatives before committing to a choice. However, the level of control over the sampling can differ: In some situations, the decision maker can decide what to sample (e.g., from which alternative) and/or how much (when to stop sampling), while in other settings, the provision of decision information is determined by external sources. Behavioral studies indicate that self-controlled sampling can modulate accuracy and recency biases in decisions from sequential numerical samples. However, the neurocognitive underpinnings of these behavioral effects are poorly understood.<br/><br/>Here, we recorded EEG while human participants accumulated numerical evidence about two choice alternatives (two-armed bandits). Before commiting to a choice, participants were free to decide from which alternatives to sample (partial control) or, additionally, when to stop sampling (full control). In matched baseline conditions, sample presentation was entirely pre-determined (no control; yoked conditions).<br/><br/>Behaviorally, we found heightened choice accuracy under full control, but not under partial control, compared to yoked baseline conditions. Unlike in previous work, recency biases were invariantly evident in all conditions under study. Turning to the EEG data, early visual responses (P1/N1) to the number samples did not differ between conditions. However, multivariate analyses revealed that the neural encoding of numerical information (cardinality, approx. 290-600 ms after sample onset), was enhanced under full control, mirroring the pattern in behavioral accuracy. Interestingly, this enhancement of numerical processing was not limited to late samples near the time of stopping, but was evident early on in the sample sequence. Consistently, we found a steeper ramping-up of late parietal signals throughout sequential evidence accumulation under full control.<br/><br/>Together, our findings indicate that control over sampling, and in particular over stopping, can enhance the encoding of numerical information in decisions from experience. The results replicate and extend previous findings of a neural numberline in multivariate EEG signals, and help understand the benefit of self-directed information search in human decision making.</p>
