        <h1>Stability and Control of Walking at Various Speed-Slope Combinations</h1><h2>Aya Alwan</h2><h3>Manoj Srinivasan, The Ohio State University; Nidhi Seethapathi, University of Pennsylvania</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Walking on sloped surfaces is a common part of navigating our streets and buildings. Understanding sloped walking is especially important because slopes are common as an alternative to stairs for people with disabilities. Persons with lower-limb disability are not able to adjust their gait to walk on slopes without direct neural control (RÃ¡bago et al. 2016). While past work has explored the differences in biomechanics between sloped and level ground walking (Pickle et al. 2016), there is very little work in understanding gait stability and control in walking on slopes. Here, we investigate how the foot placement control strategies used on level ground walking (Wang and Srinivasan, 2014) are modulated when walking on a slope. Using human subject experiments and computer simulations, we investigate how deviations in the center of mass states occurring due to small intrinsic perturbations, are corrected using foot placement during sloped walking. We collected kinematic data on healthy humans while walking on an inclined-treadmill during ascent for several speed-slope combinations. We fit linear models between hip states at mid-stance and the next foot position to infer control strategies of sloped walking. Furthermore, we simulated a walking controller using experimentally obtained linear coefficients on a computational point-mass telescoping leg model. The linear models and computer simulations show what aspects of the controller are preserved (foot placement control) and what aspects change (push-off or power stroke) as humans walk stably up a range of slopes. These findings will inform control of prosthetic limbs by providing a human-derived controller that is stable on both level-ground and slopes.</p>
