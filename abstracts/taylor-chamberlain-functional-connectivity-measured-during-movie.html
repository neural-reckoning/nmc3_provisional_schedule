        <h1>Functional connectivity measured during movie watching, but not rest, predicts social function in children and adolescents </h1><h2>Taylor Chamberlain</h2><h3>Taylor A. Chamberlain, University of Chicago; Monica D. Rosenberg, University of Chicago</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Whole-brain functional connectivity has become an increasingly popular method for relating individual differences in behavior to brain function. Functional connectivity-based models predict a variety of abilities and behaviors, including sustained attention function (Rosenberg et al., 2016) and personality dimensions (Hsu et al., 2018). Traditionally, functional connectivity research has utilized resting-state scans, thought to provide a relatively “neutral” context. However, recent work suggests that rest may not be an ideal state for studying individual differences (Finn et al., 2017). In fact, models built on functional connectivity data observed during movie-watching outperform those built on rest data in predicting cognitive and emotional phenotypes in adults (Finn et al., 2020). Here, we test whether this finding generalizes to a developmental population. Our sample consisted of 266 individuals ages 6-17, from the Healthy Brain Network Biobank (Alexander et al., 2017). We calculated individual-level functional connectomes from four fMRI scans: two resting-state scans and two scans obtained while participants watched emotionally evocative video clips. To define a summary measure of social function, we applied principal component (PC) analysis to scores on questionnaires related to social behavior (e.g., Social Responsiveness Scale) using data from Healthy Brain Network participants without usable fMRI data. Scores on the first PC, which explained 78% of the variance in the behavior-only sample, were generated for each participant in the fMRI sample. Connectome-based predictive models (Shen et al., 2017) trained and tested with 10-fold cross-validation predicted social PC scores from movie-watching, but not resting-state, data. This pattern of results was robust to effects of age, head motion, and scan duration, such that models based on movie—but not rest—data predicted social PC scores from less than three minutes of data. Thus, fMRI functional connectivity data collected during naturalistic movie viewing, rather than during rest, may best predict social function in development.</p>
