        <h1>Task state reactivation during aversive learning and avoidance</h1><h2>Toby Wise</h2><h3>Yunzhe Liu;Fatima Chowdhury;Raymond J Dolan</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Many symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders are associated with simulation of potential aversive outcomes. However, the fundamental computational and neural mechanisms that might support this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, we sought to identify neural mechanisms supporting task state reactivation as a potential mechanism that might underlie these symptoms. Subjects completed an task that involved navigating through a maze of unique task states during MEG scanning. Critically, some states were probabilistically associated with electric shock, and subjects were required to use their knowledge of the task state space to successfully avoid shock. Behaviourally, subjects used model-based inference to successfully avoid shock, and at a neural level this was linked to reactivation of subsequently chosen goal states during planning. Following outcome receipt, we observed reactivation of the unchosen goal state, potentially facilitating counterfactual updating. Finally, we found that reactivation strength was linked to activity in the medial temporal lobe, suggesting that regions such as the hippocampus might support this process. These results indicate that the brain simulates potential outcomes of hypothetical actions during avoidance, providing a candidate mechanism in which dysfunction might lead to symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders.</p>
