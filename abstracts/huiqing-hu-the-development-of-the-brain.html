        <h1>The development of the brain circuitry of conscious awareness in infancy</h1><h2>Huiqing Hu</h2><h3>Rhodri Cusack, Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Lorina Naci, Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland; Global Brain Health Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>One of the great frontiers of consciousness science is understanding how early consciousness arises in the development of the human infant. The reciprocal relationship between the default mode network (DMN) and dorsal attention network (DAN)/executive control network (ECN) has been suggested as a key feature of the brain mechanisms of conscious awareness. Nevertheless, it is poorly understood whether this relationship is present in new-born infants, or indeed whether DMN, DAN and ECN are developed at birth. We used resting-state fMRI data collected from preterm infants before (gestational age at 34.2 ± 2.0 weeks, N = 73) or at term-equivalent age (TEA, 40.9 ± 2.1 weeks, N = 73), and term infants (41.2 ± 1.7 weeks, N = 282) from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), and adults (22–36 years, N = 176) from the Human Connectome Project 1200, as a reference group to investigate these questions. We calculated the within- and between-network functional connectivity (FC) in DMN, DAN and ECN and captured their internal structure using hierarchical clustering analysis for each group. We found: 1) Infants did not exhibit higher within- relative to between-network FC in DMN and DAN until TEA, suggesting that these networks are underdeveloped before TEA. 2) The three networks were already developed in infants born at TEA. However, they were less cohesive and more atypical in their nodal structure than the adult networks. 3) Infants did not show lower FC in the DMN-DAN pairing relative to other pairings until TEA, suggesting the third trimester is a key period of the development of this reciprocal relationship. 4) Birth at or prior to TEA differentially impacted to the development of these networks and their relationship. Our study sheds light on the development of the brain circuitry that supports conscious awareness in infancy.</p>
