        <h1>Audio-visual training in older adults: 2-Interval-Forced Choice Task improves performance</h1><h2>Jessica  O'Brien</h2><h3>Annalisa Setti, University College Cork; Jason Chan, University College Cork</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A growing interest in ameliorating multisensory perception deficits in older adults arises from recent evidence showing that impaired multisensory processing, particularly in the temporal domain, may be associated with cognitive and functional impairments. Older adults exhibit an extended temporal binding window (the timeframe during which the brain integrates inputs from different senses into a multisensory percept) which has been associated with mild cognitive impairment and falls-risk. Perceptual training has proved successful in improving multisensory temporal processing in young adults, but few studies have investigated this training approach in older adults. In the present study we used a simultaneity (or synchronicity) judgement task with feedback, to train the audio-visual abilities of community-dwelling, cognitively healthy older adults. We recruited 23 older adults (M = 74.17, SD = 6.23)  and a group of 20 young adults (M = 24.20, SD = 4.23) who served as a comparison. Participants were tested before and after perceptual training using a 2-Interval Forced Choice Task (2-IFC); and the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI). After three days of training, participants improved on the 2-IFC task, with a significant narrowing of the temporal window of integration found for both groups. Generalisation of training effects was not found, with no post-training differences in perceptual sensitivity to the SIFI for either group. These findings provide evidence perceptual narrowing can be achieved in older as well as younger adults after three days of perceptual training. This research contributes to mounting evidence that multisensory processing deficits in older adultsâ€™ can be modified through targeted perceptual training. Perceptual training could potentially represent a novel intervention avenue for populations whose impairments are associated with underlying multisensory processing difficulties (e.g. fall-prone older adults).</p>
