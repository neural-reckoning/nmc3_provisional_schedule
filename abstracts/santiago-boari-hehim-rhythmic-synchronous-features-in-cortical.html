        <h1>Rhythmic synchronous features in cortical neurons of songbirds</h1><h2>Santiago Boari (He/Him)</h2><h3>Gabriel B. Mindlin, University of Buenos Aires; Ana Amador, University of Buenos Aires</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>How vocal communication signals are represented in the cortex is a major challenge for behavioral neuroscience. Beyond a descriptive code, it is relevant to unveil the dynamical mechanism responsible for the neural representation of auditory stimuli. In this work, we report evidence of synchronous neural activity in cortical neurons of canaries (Serinus canaria), in response to auditory playback of the birdâ€™s own song. The rhythmic features of canary  song allowed us to show that this synchronization was locked to syllabic repetition rates of song phrases. We recorded neurons in a brain region where sensorimotor integration occurs, showing that these neurons are activated at specific temporal instances during song playback.</p>
