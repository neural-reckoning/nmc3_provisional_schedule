        <h1>Functional and Transcriptomic Diversity of Interneurons in the Hippocampal CA3 Region Probed by Patch-Seq</h1><h2>Daniel MÃ¼ller-Komorowska (he/him)</h2><h3>Erick Martinez Chavez, Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, University of Bonn School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Germany; Sandra Blaess, Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, University of Bonn School of Medicine & University Hospital Bonn, Bonn, Germany; Heinz Beck, Institute for Experimental Epileptology and Cognition Research, University of Bonn, Germany</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Most mammalian brain regions contain diverse sets of GABAergic interneurons. These are essential in orchestrating the activity of principal neurons. Interneurons can be subclassified based on anatomical, physiological, and molecular features. In recent years, the advent of single-cell RNA-Seq has vastly expanded our knowledge of interneuron diversity regarding their transcriptional signatures. However, connecting transcriptomics with functional properties has remained challenging. The patch-seq technique quantifies electrical and transcriptomic features of the same single cell. While it lacks the high throughput of single-cell RNA-Seq, it permits direct correlation of molecular and functional properties.
We have used patch-seq in hippocampal CA3, a brain region involved in learning and memory, where GABAergic neurons are centrally involved in generating behaviorally relevant oscillations. We first measured the electrophysiological firing properties of CA3 interneurons and have subsequently sequenced the transcriptome from the same interneuron. We show that this approach can lead to the identification of novel interneuron types. We also discuss how this approach can be used to build more biologically realistic computational models of CA3. Ultimately this data could be used to model biologically plausible interneuron diversity and its functional roles.</p>
