        <h1>Travel Direction as a Fundamental Component of Human Navigation</h1><h2>You (Lilian) Cheng (she/her)</h2><h3>Sam Ling, Boston University; Chantal Stern, Boston University; Andrew Huang, University of California, Santa Barbara; Elizabeth Chrastil, University of California, Irvine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In daily life, oneâ€™s travel direction is typically correlated with head direction, but from first principles, these two factors can offer different spatial information. Although head direction has been found to be a crucial part of human navigation, it is unclear whether travel direction plays a primary role in navigation. To test this, we adopted a visual motion adaptation paradigm, which allowed probes for selectivity of travel direction. To do so, we first adapted people to visual self-motion in one direction in a virtual hallway, and then tested people during a series of visual back and forth movements, toward and away, from the initial travel direction. In both phases, the head direction was reversed occasionally to be dissociated from the travel direction, precluding optic flow from contributing to any observed adaptation effects. We then asked subjects to report their net travel direction, measuring psychometric functions for perceived travel direction, under conditions of adaptation and no-adaptation. We found high-level motion aftereffects of travel direction, suggesting that travel direction is a fundamental component of human navigation. Interestingly, subjects had a higher frequency of reporting net travel toward the adapted direction, indicating that the aftereffect is opposite to the traditional motion aftereffect. The same aftereffect was found after controlling for response biases. We propose that the travel direction system is composed of separate sensory inputs and feed-forward high-level motion processing pathways, which may overlap or interact with the head direction system. </p>
