        <h1>Role of long-range inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits </h1><h2>Jacob Ratliff</h2><h3>Renata Batista-Brito</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: Cortical activity is highly dependent on behavioral state of an animal with different states, such as sleep and wake, having profound impact on cognition and cortical processing. Despite its importance, the circuitry responsible for sensing behavioral state and modifying cortical states remains unknown. However, recent work suggests inhibitory neurons (INs) are likely involved in this regulation. While most inhibitory neurons are locally projecting, there is an IN subtype, defined by the co-expression of somatostatin (SST) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), that arborizes densely over large cortical areas. Here, we test the hypothesis that SST/nNOS cells play a crucial role in the generation of low frequency oscillations, a hallmark of multiple cortical states. <br/><br/>Results: Using a state-of-the-art set of intersectional genetic tools, we perform a variety of characterizations of SST/nNOS cells, to examine their afferent and efferent connectivity. We fluorescently label SST/nNOS cell processes using a membrane bound fluorophore to characterize output arborizations.  We found that SST/nNOS cells have dense local connectivity and long-range projections in ipsi- and contralateral cortex. We also examine inputs to SST/nNOS cells utilizing monosynaptic rabies tracing finding rich local input from excitatory and inhibitory cells. <br/>We compliment these experiments with in vivo extracellular electrophysiology paired with optogenetic manipulation of SST/nNOS cells in order to causally test the role of SST/nNOS cells towards network activity. Excitation of these cells preferentially induces low frequency oscillations while optogenetic inhibition specifically suppresses 1-3Hz oscillations. Similarly to endogenous oscillations, induced low frequency oscillations coincide with decreased gamma power, increased single unit phase locking to 1-3 Hz oscillations, and a current source density laminar profile characteristic of endogenous low frequency oscillations. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Together this set of experiments strongly suggest a role for SST/nNOS cells in the regulation of physiological low frequency oscillations across large cortical areas though the precise spatial scale is unknown. </p>
