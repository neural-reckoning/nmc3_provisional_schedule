        <h1>Transforming Sensory Cues into Aversive Emotion via Septal-Habenular Pathway</h1><h2>Guangwei Zhang</h2><h3>Zhang, Guang Wei; Shen, Li; Zhong, Wen; Xiong, Ying; Zhang, Li I.; Tao, Huizhong W.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Emotions evoked by environmental cues are important for animal survival and life quality. However, neural circuits responsible for transforming sensory signals to aversive emotion and behavioral avoidance remain unclear. Here, we found that medial septum (MS) mediates aversion induced by both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. Ablation of glutamatergic or GABAergic MS neurons results in impaired or strengthened aversion, respectively. Optogenetic activation of the two cell types results in place avoidance and preference, respectively. Cell-type-specific screening reveals that glutamatergic MS projections to the lateral habenula (LHb) are responsible for the induction of aversion, which can be antagonized by GABAergic MS projections to LHb. Additionally, the sensory-induced place avoidance is facilitated by enhanced locomotion mediated by glutamatergic MS projections to the preoptic area. Thus, MS can transmit innately aversive signals via a bottom-up multimodal sensory pathway and produce concurrent emotional and motional effects, allowing animals to efficiently avoid unfavorable environments. Zhang et al. reveal a circuit for processing innately aversive sensory signals, with glutamatergic projections from MS to LHb and POA to generate the emotional and a motional effect, respectively. This role of MS in mediating aversion is previously unrecognized.</p>
