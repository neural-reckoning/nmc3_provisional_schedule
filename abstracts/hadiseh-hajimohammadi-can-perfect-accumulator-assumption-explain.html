        <h1>Can perfect accumulator assumption explain the integration of facial features during a perceptual decision making task?</h1><h2>hadiseh hajimohammadi</h2><h3>Reza Ebrahimpour, Cognitive Science Research lab., Department of Computer Engineering, Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University, Tehran, Iran; Sajjad Zabbah, School of Cognitive Sciences, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>This study aims to investigate the integration of evidence in informative facial features during a perceptual decision making task. We hypothesize that the perfect accumulator assumption might explain the integration of the facial information. Having developed a customized algorithm, neutral faces have been geometrically morphed together such that -100 represents prototype one, +100 prototype two and zero the middle face between the two faces. The trials are designed in a way that stimuli either have three informative features (eyes, mouth, nose simultaneously) or only one informative feature (eyes, mouth, nose individually) fluctuating in time and combined with a mask throughout the trial. Eight human subjects (four women) participate in this face discrimination task after getting familiar with the pure faces with no mask and passing the train phase. The participants invited to the main phase of the experiment are instructed to maintain their gaze on the red fixation point in the center of the screen and report if the stimuli displayed on the left side of the fixation point is more similar to the first prototype or the second one. Using the logistic regression model on the probability of correct in different morph levels, it reveals that the subjects are not biased toward any of the choices. Having calculated the evidence contained in each one-informative feature trials and using the perfect accumulator assumption, we compute the expected accuracy for combining the evidence from one-informative feature trials. We show that expected accuracy calculated from the combination of one-informative feature trials are significantly smaller than the accuracy gained from the three informative features trials. Rejecting the initial hypothesis, the finding suggests that the integration of facial feature information can be more than the sum of individual information of each informative feature.</p>
