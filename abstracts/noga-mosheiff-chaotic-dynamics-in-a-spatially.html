        <h1>Chaotic dynamics in a spatially distributed network generate population-wide shared variability</h1><h2>Noga Mosheiff</h2><h3>Bard Ermentrout ; Chengcheng Huang</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neural activity in the cortex is highly variable in response to an identical stimulus. This variability is correlated among different neurons and has been found to be low dimensional. Cortical population recordings have also shown that shared variability decreases with the distance between a pair of neurons. Previously, Huang et al. demonstrated that spatiotemporal dynamics in spiking neural networks can give a rise to population-wide shared variability. In this work, we show that the population-wide shared variability can be internally generated in deterministic recurrent networks with chaotic rate dynamics. We analyzed the dynamical regimes of recurrent networks with excitatory and inhibitory populations, which are spatially distributed on a ring or a torus. We found that the networks have dynamical regimes of different regular solutions, depending on the temporal and spatial scales of inhibition, such as static bumps, bulk oscillations, traveling waves and alternating bumps. In particular, in a parameter regime where the excitatory projection width is close to the inhibitory projection width, the networks exhibit chaotic rate dynamics. The chaotic solutions contain low-frequency power in rate variability and have low-dimensional and distance-dependent correlations, in agreement with experimental findings. Further, we found that the parameter regime of chaos becomes larger when the networks are driven by correlated noisy inputs. The chaotic regime expands as the variance of the correlated noise component increases, while being insensitive to the variance of the independent noise components. </p>
