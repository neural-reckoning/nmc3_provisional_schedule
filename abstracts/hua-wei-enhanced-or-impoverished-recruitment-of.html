        <h1>Enhanced or impoverished recruitment of top-down attentional control of inhibition in test anxiety </h1><h2>Hua Wei</h2><h3>Hua Wei,Southeast University;  Renlai Zhou,Southeast University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Existing evidence shows that test anxiety impairs individuals’ inhibition. However, controversy exits as to whether a high test anxiety (HTA) individual, when completing an experimental task, increases or decreases top-down attentional control resources to maintain (high) task performance. To fill the gap, the present study examined whether a HTA individual will increase or decrease recruitment of top-down attentional control resources to complete inhibition task. In this flanker task experiment, individuals were confronted with a threat or no threat context in combination with a low or a high working memory load. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were collected and the Event Related Potential (ERP) N2 measured top-down attentional control resource allocation. The EEG results showed three crucial significant differences: in comparison to low test anxiety (LTA) individuals: (1) in a no threat and low working memory load condition, HTA individuals had larger incongruent N2 amplitudes; (2) in a no threat and high working memory load condition, HTA individuals had larger incongruent and congruent N2 amplitudes; and (3) in a threat and high working memory load condition, HTA individuals had smaller incongruent N2 amplitudes. This significance pattern: (1) clarifies the neural mechanism underlying the frontal lobe’s involvement in the processing of an inhibition task; (2) supports the idea that, in order to maintain (high) task performance, HTA individuals tend to engage in enhanced recruitment of top-down attentional control of inhibition; but also shows that (3) in case of a threat coinciding with a high working memory load, HTA individuals fail to employ this compensatory strategy as they display impoverished top-down attentional control of inhibition. </p>
