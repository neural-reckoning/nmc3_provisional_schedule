As social interactions become increasingly online through social media, information consumed through this medium shapes how we think. We examined the neural underpinnings guiding the impact of information and context (e.g., social vs cyber) on decision making, where information credibility varies greatly. In this study, 240 healthy participants answered a questionnaire surrounding a variety of current issues (e.g., vaccinations, capital punishment, etc.) at three points in the study: (1) before interacting with a simulated social media environment that presented news articles including real and fake information, (2) following the social media platform interaction, and (3) after talking to other participants in a group. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured during interactions with the social media platform. Participants were then scored based on how much they changed their opinion and categorized as “cyber influenced”, “socially influenced”, both, or neither, in order to evaluate the hypothesis that variability in opinions is linked to variability in neural behavior. Neural variability was analyzed using two methods: (1) traditional power analysis and (2) connectivity strength using a network approach that measures statistical relationships among nodes (EEG electrodes). Results show the respective neural pathways of information processing via digital interaction and in-person social interaction were not statistically different, suggesting that similar neural processes may serve both types of decisions to change their opinion, regardless of context. We further investigated this finding using more sensitive approaches to aggregate network changes, differentiating individuals that are more susceptible to information presented through a social media platform. Our results suggest different scales of neural processing underlying decision making are at play when individuals are presented with a variety of reliable and unreliable information in different contexts. </p>
