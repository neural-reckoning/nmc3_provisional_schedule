        <h1>PaSClass: A Machine Learning Pipeline to classify excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the rat Parasubiculum. </h1><h2>Alexandra Tzilivaki</h2><h3>Rosanna P. Sammons ; Dietmar Schmitz</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The parasubiculum (PaS) is a small brain region that belongs to the parahippocampal formation, lying between the presubiculum and the medial entorhinal cortex.  PaS neurons are divided into 3 main classes: WFS1 positive excitatory neurons, Reelin positive interneurons, and parvalbumin (PV) interneurons. Using in vitro patch-clamp recordings, we analyzed the electrophysiological profile of more than 500 PaS neurons. Immunolabelling information was available only for ~50% of the dataset. Of this, the vast majority were WFS1+ positive neurons.  A small proportion was Reelin-positive that exhibited similar electrophysiological properties to WFS1, while the least represented class was PV interneurons. For such a multiclass and imbalanced dataset with similar electrophysiological features for the WFS1 and Reelin classes, the commonly used threshold analyses or clustering approaches were inefficient to predict the class of the remaining neurons. Thus, we designed and developed a machine learning classification pipeline to predict the class of our PaS neurons. Firstly, we implemented and tested multiple classification algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier, Complement Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, Multilayer Perceptron Model (MLP), and the Random Forest Classifier (RF). Using exclusively the dataset where the immunolabelling information was available, we used stratification and cross-validation, to test the performance of the models. Appropriate class weights were added where applicable. RF and MLP yielded the highest accuracy scores across multiple trials. We continued by training and extensively testing the performance of our two best models, the RF and MLP. Finally, we used them to label the neurons lacking immunolabelling data. Tested models returned identical labels for 90% of the 244 cases. Cells with different predicted labels were excluded. The whole approach was performed using the open-access Python Sklearn package. We consider this pipeline as a new tool for predicting the staining of neurons when immunolabelling and morphological information is limited.</p>
