        <h1>Studying the role of the large neutral-amino acid transporter Slc7a5 in autism spectrum disorder and microcephaly</h1><h2>Lisa Knaus</h2><h3>Bernadette Basilico; Nicole Amberg; LIl Andersen; Thomas Ruelicke; Simon Hippenmeyer; Gaia Novarino</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The solute carrier transporter 7a5 (SLC7A5), a large neutral amino acid transporter, has a crucial role in maintaining branched chain amino acid (BCAA) levels in the brain. We have identified several patients harboring a homozygous missense mutation in the SLC7A5 gene, who are on the autism spectrum (ASD) and present with motor deficits and microcephaly. In mice, a deletion of Slc7a5 from the blood brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells causes decreased levels of BCAAs in the brain, altered cap-dependent translation and severe behavioral abnormalities including sociability and gait defects. 
Now, aiming to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the microcephalic phenotype of the patients, we have generated a conditional knock-out mouse line (cKO) of Slc7a5 specifically targeting neuroprogenitor cells of the developing cortex and hippocampus. 
These cKO mice present with a microcephalic brain, thereby recapitulating the patientâ€™s phenotype. We have found that the severe reduction of cortical thickness is caused by increased apoptotic activity within the postnatal cortex. Interestingly, these elevated rates of cell death co-occur with an endogenous wave of neuronal apoptosis within a specific developmental time window. This apoptotic program has been shown to be regulated by the activity levels of cortical pyramidal neurons and is crucial for postnatal network refinement. We now aim to elucidate potential contributions of Slc7a5 to this critical process, thereby focusing on a cell type-specific role of the transporter during this neurodevelopmental time window.
