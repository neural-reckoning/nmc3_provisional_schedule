        <h1>Erasing Fear: Challenges for Decoded Neurofeedback</h1><h2>Jorge Morales</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neural interventions in humans are either anatomically specific but invasive (e.g. ablations of cortical tissue), or non-invasive but with anatomical limited resolution (e.g. TMS). Most of these interventions are functionally non-specific. Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is different: by leveraging fMRI and machine learning, DecNef creates non-invasive, functionally targeted interventions of neural activity. Aided by external reward, subjects unconsciously self-regulate targeted multi-variate patterns of their own BOLD-activity. Subjects self-activate patterns of neural activity indistinguishable from patterns corresponding to seeing images of some target stimulus type (e.g. spiders). Through trial and error and a sophisticated online readout of their neural activity paired with a reward system, subjects learn to create “spider” activity patterns in the absence of spiders. The clinical applications are promising. A popular treatment of phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder is exposure therapy, but it takes an enormous toll on patients who have to endure being exposed to their source of fear and trauma. With DecNef, because patients are unaware of the target, they can be *unconsciously* “exposed” to patterns of neural activity similar to those of their feared target effectively reducing their phobic symptoms without undergoing the emotional labor. Despite its promise for cognitive neuroscience and for the clinic, DecNef’s mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. This raises theoretical questions about our understanding of neural representations and neural intervention that I’ll discuss in this talk:<br/><br/>(1) What is the status of the neural representations targeted by DecNef?<br/><br/>(2) What kind of voxel-to-neural activity mapping can allow its impressive yet mysterious functional-specificity?<br/><br/>(3) Because of its underdetermined and potentially long-lasting effects (up to two months), can harmful or undesirable patterns of activity be activated unbeknownst to subjects. Could new phobias be instilled, precious memories altered or erased, undesired associations created?</p>
