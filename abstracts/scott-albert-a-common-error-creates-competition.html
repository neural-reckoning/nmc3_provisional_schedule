        <h1>A common error creates competition between parallel sensorimotor learning systems</h1><h2>Scott Albert</h2><h3>Jihoon Jang; Adrian Haith; Gonzalo Lerner; Valeria Della-Maggiore; John W. Krakauer; Reza Shadmehr</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>During sensorimotor adaptation, the brain can rely on two separate learning systems: an intentional explicit system that responds to instructions, and an implicit system that is largely unconscious. However, it is unclear whether these putative systems learn independently from separate kinds of error, or compete to learn from the same error. Here, we mathematically express these two possibilities and consider their diverging predictions. When we test these predictions, we find that implicit and explicit systems share a common error; increases in explicit strategy siphon error away from the implicit system, thus impairing its learning. This negative interaction can mask changes in implicit learning such as savings and interference, that can be unveiled by suppressing explicit strategy. Together, the data suggest that in most cases, implicit and explicit systems are in competition to learn from a single error: task outcome. Cases that violate this rule suggest a second error source that also drives implicit adaptation, but leads to competition between two implicit learning modules. Altogether, the data show that patterns of implicit adaptation are shaped by competition between parallel learning systems.</p>
