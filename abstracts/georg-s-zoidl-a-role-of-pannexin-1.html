        <h1>A role of pannexin-1 channels in an experimental zebrafish model for Parkinson’s Disease</h1><h2>Georg S Zoidl</h2><h3>Georg R. Zoidl, York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Pannexins (Panx) are a group of channel proteins abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and many vertebrates' tissues. The channels play essential roles in transporting Ca2+ and ATP. Panx1 is implicated in epilepsy, stroke, trauma, inflammation, or pain. A role in Parkinson’s disease has been proposed, but evidence thus far is lacking.  Here, the locomotor activity and visual-motor response of wild-type Tupfel longfin and panx1a knockout zebrafish larvae were tested after treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). MPTP is known to induce Parkinson's disease-like effects in the zebrafish by blocking the Complex I in mitochondria. Short term treatment with MPTP caused a decrease in the movement of the larvae. Locomotor activity worsened after incubation with Panx1 inhibitors probenecid and mefloquine. The analysis of biomarker expression levels demonstrated the upregulation of genes in panx1a knockout larvae with known functions in mitochondrial health and dopamine synthesis. A transcriptome analysis authenticated a broad dysregulation of metabolic processes, such as those affecting mitochondrial health. It was concluded that panx1a channels play roles in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in the zebrafish. Loss-of-function contributes to the severity of outcomes in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease. </p>
