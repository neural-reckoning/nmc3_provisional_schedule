        <h1>Predictive integration of landmarks for future gaze commands in monkey frontal cortex</h1><h2>Vishal Bharmauria</h2><h3>Adrian Schütz; Xiaogang Yan; Hongying Wang; Frank Bremmer; John Douglas Crawford</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The brain is essentially a predictive machine and constantly generates internal models from the environmental inputs that keep us prepared for future action. How does the brain use visual landmarks for future gaze commands and what are the neural underpinnings thereof? Recently, we showed that the brain detects sudden landmark shifts in the neural activity of two important gaze areas: the frontal (FEF) and supplementary eye field (SEF, and also involved in prediction and higher cognitive control) (Bharmauria et al. 2020a,b). Here, we simulataneously recorded spatially tuned neurons from the FEF (n = 147) and SEF (n = 68) of two monkeys (Macaca mullata) trained on a cue-conflict memory gaze task where they could use quasi-predictable (fixed amplitude, variable direction) masked landmark shifts for future gaze command. There was a 30 % influence of the landmark shift on gaze and it caused the gaze endpoints to deviate in a ‘donut-like’ pattern around the original target. We then fit neural response fields (RFs) against a target-to-gaze (T-G) continuum in eye-coordinates and tracked their evolution in the spatiotemporal domain (from visual response onset until the mask-off/landmark-on). A sudden predictive shift (before mask-on) toward gaze was noticed in the SEF but not the FEF responses. Collectively, these results along with our previous findings (Bharmauria et al. 2020a,b) suggest that in the gaze system the SEF provides control signals to the FEF for the final gaze command. First, the SEF detects the quasi-predictive information in its neural activity and then relays it to the FEF for incorporating the final gaze command through closely knit visual-visuomotor-motor circuitries between both areas with opposing roles.
