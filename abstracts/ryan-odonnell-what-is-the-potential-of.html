        <h1>What is the potential of decoding?: A time course comparison between ERP and machine learning classification analyses</h1><h2>Ryan O'Donnell</h2><h3>Brad Wyble, Pennsylvania State University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neural decoding is a popular method in cognitive research. With decoding, neural data from individual trials or batches are categorized by a statistical classifier (e.g. support vector machines, SVM, or deep neural networks). However, neural decoding analyses stand in contrast to traditional event related potential (ERP) analyses, which average EEG data across same-condition trials to enhance voltage signals related to a particular experimental manipulation. This study set out to assess the differences in the timecourse of voltage signals obtained via task-based ERP versus the  information gain obtained via item-based neural decoding analyses. To do so, participants completed two target identification tasks (targets could be a face or body) under different visual presentations (Single vs RSVP presentation), which have previously been shown to elicit latency differences in target-related ERP components like the P3 (Craston, Wyble & Bowman, 2006). Recorded data was analyzed using conventional ERP techniques as well as machine learning classification techniques (in this case, a linear SVM trained to classify face from body trials within presentation format). The two analyses provided different conclusions about the influences of presentation format on cognitive processes, with ERP replicating the previously observed differences in P3 amplitudes and latencies whereas machine learning  demonstrated no substantial differences in classification accuracy or latency between formats. Overall, these results highlight the importance of comparing ERP and decoding analysis techniques in EEG. If decoding is driven by the voltage signals present in ERPs, one might have assumed that differences in ERP latencies would be reflected in the temporal profile of classification. However, this was not true.  The failure to find a clear correspondence between condition differences in the timecourse of  ERPs and decoding profiles suggests that classifiers are finding statistical regularities in target-related scalp voltages that are not scaling with traditional task-based ERPs measures.
