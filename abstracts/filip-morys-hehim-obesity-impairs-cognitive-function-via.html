        <h1>Obesity impairs cognitive function via metabolic syndrome and cerebrovascular disease: an SEM analysis in 15,000 adults from the UK Biobank</h1><h2>Filip Morys (he/him)</h2><h3>Mahsa Dadar, Laval University; Alain Dagher, McGill University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Chronic obesity is associated with several complications, including cognitive impairment and dementia. However, we have piecemeal knowledge of the mechanisms linking obesity to central nervous system damage. Candidate mechanisms are metabolic syndrome, consisting of inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. While there have been several neuroimaging studies linking adiposity to changes in brain morphometry, a comprehensive investigation of the relationship has so far not been done. Here we use structural equation modelling in 15,000 individuals from the UK Biobank to identify the causal chain linking adiposity to cognitive dysfunction. We found that body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were positively related to higher plasma C-reactive protein, dyslipidemia, occurrence of hypertension and diabetes, all of which were in turn related to cerebrovascular disease as measured by volume of white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. White mater hyperintensities were associated with lower cortical thickness and volume and higher subcortical volumes, which were associated with cognitive deficits. We also observed that white matter dysconnectivity, as measured by fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, was a major cause of impaired cognition. Our results have clinical implications, supporting a role for the management of adiposity in the prevention of late-life dementia and cognitive decline.</p>
