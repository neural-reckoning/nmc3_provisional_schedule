        <h1>The influence of target reward on motor planning and online motor decision</h1><h2>Antoine  De Comite</h2><h3>Frederic Crevecoeur, Université catholique de Louvain; Philippe Lefèvre, Université catholique de Louvain</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The central nervous system uses sophisticated strategies to plan and execute upper limb reaching movements. Motor planning involves the selection of a goal amongst multiple options that is biased by factors such as the biomechanical cost or the expected gains of the potential movements. Likewise, motor execution is influenced by parameters such as reward, which invigorates reaching movements in a way that is coherent with robust optimal feedback control models. To date, the effect of costs and rewards on planning and control has been studied separately, and it remains unknown whether and how target selection may be influenced by reward following disturbances during ongoing actions. To address this question, we designed an experiment in which we sought to determine whether the distribution of rewards amongst three potential options (either all targets had the same reward or the lateral targets had smaller reward) had an influence on motor planning and execution in presence of unexpected mechanical perturbations. We observed a decrease of the online change in target goal when the lateral targets had smaller rewards, for all mechanical perturbation levels. Interestingly we observed, when all the targets had the same reward, a negative correlation between the EMG activity of muscles and the propensity to switch target online: higher activity correlated with smaller change propensity. In order to confirm this effect, we designed a similar second experiment in which a leftward background load was applied through some trials to pre-excite the muscles. Remarkably, we observed that the application of the leftward background load decreased the frequency of switch toward the leftward target at all perturbation levels. In all, our study revealed that multiple mechanisms underlie reward-dependent planning and control of movement: a robust control strategy that leverages gain-scaling and a more flexible control strategy that enables rapid and online target changes. </p>
