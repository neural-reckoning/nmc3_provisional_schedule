        <h1>The response to background motion: characteristics of a hand stabilization mechanism</h1><h2>Emily Crowe</h2><h3>Emily M. Crowe, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Jeroen B. J. Smeets, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Eli Brenner, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>When making goal-directed movements towards a target, our hand deviates from its path in the direction of sudden background motion. We introduce the Hand Stabilization Hypothesis to explain this ‘manual following response’. This hypothesis suggests that any abrupt background motion near the desired endpoint of one’s action is attributed to that point having moved relative to oneself. This leads to the hand following any motion within that relevant region to stabilize the ongoing movement. In six experiments, we accumulate evidence in support of this hypothesis. Participants were asked to intercept a moving target when it reached a certain area and, at a fixed moment during the hand’s interceptive action, background structures started to move either leftward or rightward. We determined the response of the hand by subtracting its velocity when the background moved leftward from its velocity when the background moved rightward. The participants’ hand responded to background motion even if the majority of background structures remained static or if background structures were only briefly visible. Thus, the response cannot be driven by judgments of self-motion based on the instantaneous optic flow within the relevant part of the background. The response was most sensitive to motion close to where the target was to be hit, both in the visual field and in depth. Even motion of only three small dots in that area was sufficient to elicit a response. Together these experiments characterise the fast and simple hand stabilization mechanism that is likely to be relevant for the control of an ongoing hand movement in a dynamic environment.</p>
