        <h1>Synaptic Scaling of Excitatory Post Synaptic firings in Hippocampal Neurons. </h1><h2>Yerram  Pooja Chowdary </h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Synaptic plasticity provides the basis for modeling of learning, memory, and development in neural circuits. Information is stored in neural circuits through long-standing changes in synaptic strengths. Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), in which synaptic strength changes in a synapse-specific manner. In contrast, little attention has been paid to molecular mechanisms that regulate the local synaptic signaling, postsynaptic firing, or large-scale changes in network activity which are required to induce synaptic scaling. In cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons persistent potentiation, and depression of glutamatergic synapses were induced by correlated spiking of postsynaptic neurons. Chronic blockade of hippocampal culture activity increased the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over 48 hours ESPC amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate and affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Here, we selectively block postsynaptic firing in individual neurons while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength. Such synaptic scaling may help to ensure that it is rapidly induced by a block of postsynaptic firing, but not by the local synaptic blockade. Hippocampal neurons thus homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their own firing rate, a mechanism with the computational advantage of efficiently normalizing synaptic strengths without interfering with synapse-specific mechanisms of information storage.<br/></p>
