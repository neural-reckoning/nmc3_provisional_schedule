        <h1>Motor unit firing frequencies are muscle dependent during static contraction: importance of axon distance?</h1><h2>Eric Kirk</h2><h3>Eric A. Kirk, The University of Western Ontario; Charles L. Rice, The University of Western Ontario</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>          The somatic nervous system innervates hundreds of different striated muscles, each comprised of a sub-population of motor units (MU). For any voluntary muscle contraction (to remain static or move the joint) MU activation is required that first involves MU recruitment (i.e. spatial control) and subsequent firing rate modulation (i.e. temporal control) to enable precision in producing tension at the tendon. Because contractile output is affected by structural (fibre type, innervation ration, etc.) as well as synaptic (intrinsic and extrinsic) properties, our aim was to understand which structural factor is most probable to affect the observation of different MU firing frequencies among muscles. Thus, we generated four hypotheses based on: fibre type, innervation type (brainstem vs. spinal), axon distance and anatomical location.
           From an aggregated dataset containing MU firing rates from 15 different muscles and thousands of MU samples from male and female adult participants, post-hoc statistical comparisons were made based on the probability of an observed model (alternative) residing within a simulated distribution of model outputs (null distribution). For each hypothesis test, the simulated distribution was based on a fitted y-intercept with the addition of bootstrapping from studentized residuals of the observed model. We then performed 100 iterations of case bootstrapping for each hypothesis. Statistical significance was determined by a two-sided p-value calculation, where the observed slope coefficient (from the alternative) acted as the alpha value against the simulated distribution estimate. 
          Of the four hypotheses, axon distance to the muscle was the most probable hypothesis to reject the null estimate (q-value < 0.005). Therefore, axon distance as a factor to effect firing rates among muscles was least likely in our dataset to occur by chance, and we speculate that important axon-dependent structures related to internode length and maximum conduction velocity act as important limits on firing rate distributions.
