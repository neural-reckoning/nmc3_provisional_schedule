        <h1>Robustness and circuit dynamics of reciprocally inhibitory neurons to perturbation and modulation</h1><h2>Ekaterina Morozova</h2><h3>Peter Newstein; Eve Marder</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Essential rhythmic motor patterns are produced by central pattern generators (CPGs). Half-center oscillators (HCOs) are the building blocks of many CPG networks. They consist of two typically nonoscillotary neurons, or groups of neurons, connected by reciprocal inhibitory synapses. There are two fundamental mechanisms of antiphase oscillations in reciprocally inhibitory circuits: “release” and “escape”. We describe how dynamics of HCOs with “release” and “escape” mechanisms is modulated by their intrinsic properties, neurotransmitters and global perturbations, such as temperature.
One way of exploring how synaptic and intrinsic properties shape motor patterns is to control the parameters critical for production of neural output. Thus, we used the dynamic clamp to create HCO circuits of two pharmacologically isolated biological neurons from the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab. HCO circuits were formed by connecting two neurons with artificial reciprocal inhibitory synapses and adding hyperpolarization-activated inward currents. 
HCOs with “release” and “escape” mechanisms produce alternating bursting for different sets of synaptic and H-conductances. These conductances must be tightly correlated to achieve robust bursting in “escape”, but not in “release” mode. H-current oppositely modulates the cycle frequency of HCOs with different mechanisms, decreasing the frequency in “release”, while increasing the frequency in “escape” mode.
CPGs must be robust to various perturbations. Temperature is a global perturbation that differentially affects all biological processes. We assessed the response of HCOs to temperature changes. Increase in temperature could switch the mechanism of oscillations from “escape” to “release” and, thus, alter the way circuits respond to external stimuli. HCOs with “release” mechanism are less robust to temperature increases.
Our results demonstrate that reciprocally inhibitory circuits with different underlying mechanisms of oscillations are distinctly modulated by the intrinsic conductances, neurotransmitters and external stimuli/ perturbations.</p>
