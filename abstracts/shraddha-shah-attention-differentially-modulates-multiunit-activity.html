Attention effects, such as gain modulation of neuronal firing rate, are observed in all visual brain areas, including the visual thalamus (McAlonan et al., 2008; Maunsell, 2015). However, magnitudes of attentional gain modulations within and across visual brain areas differ depending on neuronal types, task, measurement, neuronal feature selectivity, etc. Diversity of attention effects across visual brain areas could suggest that attention effects depend on the functional architecture of a given area. To test this possibility, we evaluated attentional gain modulation in visual areas with distinct functional architectures using an aggregate measure of neuronal activity, multiunit firing rate. We recorded from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) in macaque monkeys performing a contrast change detection task requiring covert shifts of visual spatial attention. Because multiunit activity reflects pooled signals from neurons embedded in the local functional architecture, we tested specific predictions about the dependence of attentional modulation of multiunit firing rates on functional architecture. We found evidence for unique relationships between multiunit activity and functional architecture in the LGN and V1. Effects were mostly consistent across different thresholds used to sort multiunits and temporal analysis windows. Consistent with single unit measures, attentional modulation of multiunits depended on whether multiunits were tuned to task-relevant visual features. Together these findings suggest that attentional modulation of multiunit activity in visual areas must be considered within the context of the underlying functional architecture.
