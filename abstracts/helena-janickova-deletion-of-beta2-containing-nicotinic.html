        <h1>Deletion of beta2-containing nicotinic receptors in striatal neurons leads to behavioral alterations and increased striatal activity</h1><h2>Helena Janickova</h2><h3>Alice Abbondanza, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic; Martin Modrak, Institute of Microbiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic; Jan Elias, Czech Centre for Phenogenomics, Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Vestec, Czech Republic; Trisha Dhabalia, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are relatively less expressed by striatal neurons comparing to other brain regions and their expression by individual types of striatal neurons as well as their functional significance is rather elusive. According to the traditional view supported mainly by electrophysiological data, nAChRs are mainly expressed by striatal interneurons while the expression by striatal principal neurons (commonly referred to as medium spiny neurons, MSNs) is very low. Striatal interneurons represent only approximately 5 % of neurons in the striatum and they consist of a group of cholinergic interneurons (CINs) and several different types of GABAergic interneurons (GABAINs). In our study, we reviewed previously published single cell RNA sequencing data1 to investigate the pattern of beta2-containing nAChRs (beta2* nAChRs) expression by striatal neurons. Furthermore, we performed deletion of beta2* nAChRs in striatal neurons to test the effect of the deletion on behavior and neuronal activity. By examining the previously published data, we found no difference in the RNA expression level between striatal interneurons and MSNs. In contrast, the non-specific deletion of beta2* nAChRs in striatal neurons led to increased neuronal activity evaluated by Fos immunofluorescence, both at baseline and after induction with amphetamine. This suggests that the deletion mainly affected inhibitory GABAINs leading to increased MSNs' activity. In addition, mice with the beta2* nAChRs deletion in striatal neurons showed alterations in social preference test and increased anxiety together with mild cognitive alterations and hyperactivity. This behavioral phenotype is less prominent but generally in agreement with the phenotype observed in global beta2-KO mice2.    <br/>References:<br/>1.
