        <h1>Computation noise promotes cognitive resilience to adverse conditions in humans and recurrent networks</h1><h2>Valentin Wyart</h2><h3>Charles Findling, École Normale Supérieure</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Random noise in information processing systems is widely seen as detrimental to function. But despite the large trial-to-trial variability of neural activity, humans show a remarkable adaptability to unexpected adverse events during goal-directed behavior. The origin of this cognitive ability, described as constitutive of general intelligence, is still disputed. In this talk, I will show that implementing computation noise in recurrent neural networks boosts their cognitive resilience to a variety of adverse events entirely unseen during training, in a way that strikingly resembles human cognition in similar conditions. In contrast to neural networks featuring exact computations, noisy networks and humans acquire behavioral hallmarks of Bayesian inference in a ‘zero-shot’ fashion – without prior experience with conditions that require these computations for maximizing rewards. These findings suggest that human intelligence may ride on computation noise to promote near-optimal behavior in adverse conditions without any engineered cognitive sophistication.</p>
