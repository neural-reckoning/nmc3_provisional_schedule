        <h1>“I listen for your voice”: The Influence of art/design on parental stress, experience and engagement in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit</h1><h2>Laurena Clark</h2><h3>Laurena Clark, York University; David Scadding, York University; Dr. Upali Nanda, University of Michigan; Dr. Joseph DeSouza, York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Current research indicates a strong correlation between parental involvement in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and better health outcomes for babies.  Healthcare Interior Designers are responsible for designing spaces that not only meet all current standards and best practices, but also consider the experiences of the people who inhabit these spaces.  With the focus of healthcare design shifting towards an evidence-based approach, there is opportunity to expand the current body of knowledge with further research, to help guide the design of facilities and have a positive impact on the health and wellbeing of patients, visitors and staff.  My thesis focuses on the idea of integrating environmental graphic art installations in the NICU to provide a medium through which messages can be communicated to parents to support, educate and encourage them to spend more time with their babies, potentially leading to better health outcomes.  Research will incorporate findings from Contemporary Western Art/Architectural History, specifically looking at art in hospitals, Environmental Psychology to investigate how we are affected by the built environments that surrounds us, and Visual Communication to understand how text, image and content can be used to convey a message with the goal of affecting human behaviour.  This is a unique and exciting research opportunity that extends across disciplines, where a gap in the research exists.  If this contribution bridges the gap, there is the potential to have significant impact on the health and wellbeing of people in the NICU. </p>
