        <h1>Transthyretin and Alzheimer’s disease: Systematic review</h1><h2>Arjumand Faruqi</h2><h3>Ahmad Ozair </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Introduction:
Prealbumin or transthyretin (TTR), a protein, is found in various tissues, including the brain. [1]
Studies have found a conflicting role of TTR in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). [1-3]
No systematic review, the highest quality of evidence, currently exists on this. Only narrative reviews exist.

 Material and methods:
1. We conducted the systematic review as per the PRISMA checklist and flowchart
We conducted a search on PUBMED/ MEDLINE database on 15th June 2020.
2. We used the search function: ((transthyretin) OR (prealbumin)) AND (Alzheimer's disease)
3. We found 95 eligible studies after the three steps of screening.
Identification: Records identified through database searching (PUBMED) (n=346). Additional records identified through other sources (n=0). Duplicate Removal: Records after duplicates removed (n=346).
Screening:
  Records screened (n = 346), Records excluded (n=184).
  Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n =162). Full-text articles excluded, with reasons (n=67).
Included- Studies included in qualitative synthesis (n=95).

Results:
Majority of studies find that TTR has an overall neuroprotective role in AD.
TTR has been found to clear Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide molecules and inhibit Aβ aggregation.
TTR is found to influence A-beta levels in a gender-specific manner, its action influenced by testosterone and estradiol.
There is enough evidence to suggest that TTR in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) comes from 3 sources: (1) synthesis by neurons, (2) synthesis by choroid plexus; and (3) serum TTR also diffuses into the CSF.
Studies done in CSF report that TTR levels in CSF are significantly decreased in AD.
In CSF of patients with AD, abundant oxidized iOS forms of TTR are detected.
Studies done in serum also find that TTR levels inversely correlate with disease progression. Serum TTR levels are found to be lowered in AD patients.
Serum levels of TTR have been found to be a good biomarker for AD for diagnostics.

Discussion:
We could not perform quantitative synthesis due to lack of large observational or interventional studies in clinical practice.
We only searched the PUBMED/MEDLINE database, and did not utilise SCOPUS or EMBASE.
