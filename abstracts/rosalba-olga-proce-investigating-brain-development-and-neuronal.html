In particular, the relevance of CxCl12/CxCr4 axis has been extensively characterized in leukocytes migration and homing as well as tumour growth and invasion. In addition, the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 system has been centrally implicated in the developmental regulation of neuronal migration, in particular of GABAergic inhibitory neurons of cerebral cortex and the cerebellum (Purkinje cells). <br/>WHIM syndrome is a rare form of juvenile immunodeficiency characterized by Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, recurrent Infections and Myelokathexis, and it is caused by autosomal dominant CXCR4 mutation, which blocks the receptor internalization after Cxcl12 stimulation inducing the persistent activation of Cxcr4. WHIM patients are susceptible to potentially life-threatening bacterial, and to a less extent, to viral infections. The immunological signs of WHIM syndrome have been extensively investigated through the well-established genetic animal model, which faithfully recapitulates the immune phenotype. In this project, we aim at characterizing the effects of Cxcr4/Cxcl12 alterations on the development of the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum by integrating cellular, molecular and behavioural analysis of WHIM model. Our preliminary data suggest that GABAergic cortical and cerebellar systems are developmentally impaired in WHIM mice, at both molecular and morphological levels, with long lasting detrimental effects on neuronal wiring and socio-motor behaviours. It is compelling that the first neuro-psychological assessment of WHIM patients correlates with our experimental in vivo results. Thus, we aim at investigating the pathological mechanisms underlying these defects, to evaluate the neuronal phenotype- for long overlooked- and, ultimately identify specific therapeutic approaches for WHIM syndrome in humans.<br/></p>
