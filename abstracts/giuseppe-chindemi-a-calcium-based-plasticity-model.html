        <h1>A calcium-based plasticity model predicts long-term potentiation and depression in the somatosensory cortex</h1><h2>Giuseppe Chindemi</h2><h3>Giuseppe Chindemi, UNIGE and BBP; Marwan Abdellah, BBP; Oren Amsalem, HUJI; Ruth Benavides-Piccione, UPM; Vincent Delattre, EPFL; Michael Doron, HUJI; Andras Ecker, BBP; James King, BBP; Pramod Kumbhar, BBP; Caitlin Monney, BBP; Rodrigo Perin, LNMC; Christian RÃ¶ssert, BBP; Werner Van Geit, BBP; Javier DeFelipe, UPM; Michael Graupner, SPPIN; Idan Segev, HUJI; Henry Markram, BBP and LNMC; Eilif Muller, BBP and UM</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Long-term plasticity of synapses between pyramidal cells (PCs) is considered one of the key mechanisms underlying learning and memory in the brain. However, potentiation and depression of synaptic responses have been experimentally tested for only a few of these connections in the neocortex. This gap poses a significant barrier for the study of learning mechanisms. Here we show that a calcium-based plasticity rule regulating layer 5 PC synapses holds also for several other pyramidal-to-pyramidal connections in a digital model of the somatosensory cortex. In particular, we show that differences in postsynaptic calcium dynamics are sufficient to explain the in vitro results on PC connections plasticity. We therefore propose that a common set of plasticity mechanisms is shared among PCs. Our results provide a piece of the puzzle towards understanding the role of the different PC types in neocortical learning.</p>
