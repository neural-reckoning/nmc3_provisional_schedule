        <h1>GIN-tonic: collaboration in research made easy</h1><h2>Julien Colomb</h2><h3>Achilleas Koutsou, Thorsten Arendt, Deepti Mittal, Keisuke Sehara, â€¨Rike-Benjamin Schuppner, Thomas Wachtler, Matthew Larkum, Julien Colomb</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Computer scientists have seen their collaboration highly facilitated by the use of GitHub-like platforms. Their work could not be done without the use of issues, pull requests and merges, not any more. However, we have been waiting for a "GitHub for science" tool for a decade. Indeed, the technology needed to deal with research data specificities makes the repository administration very complex and time consuming, and requires relatively high computer skills. <br/><br/>We have developed a toolkit to bring the power of GitHub to the researchers. Behind the scene, we are using advanced technologies: git-annex deals with large files; git modules brings access rights and publication at the sub-folder levels; gogs brings the github-like collaboration tool, and the tonic application (in go) facilitates and automates complex administrative tasks (like the creation of the research repo). Last but not least, we also worked on a folder structure template to facilitate and promote file sharing, reproducible research and research data management.<br/><br/>Similar to the beverage, gin-tonic was tricky to prepare, but now you can relax and enjoy it. Once installed, you only need to save your digital files at a right place and double-click synchronization files from time to time:  then you get access to all advanced features via your internet browser. In addition, it is a free open source software and works as a data backup system.<br/><br/>Gin-tonic stands for: GitHub for neuroscience - templates and other necessary tools for git control</p>
