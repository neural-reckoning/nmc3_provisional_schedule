Large-scale simulations using simple point neurons are an important tool for studying and understanding how network dynamics implement neural computations. Given that the EEG is generated by spatially separated transmembrane currents, it cannot be computed directly from point neurons. Here, we asked the question whether a combination of quantities defined in point-neuron network models could accurately approximate the EEG. We evaluated different candidate “EEG proxies”, i.e., firing rates, membrane potentials, synaptic currents, and compared their outputs with the EEG generated when spikes produced by the point-neuron network serve as synaptic input to a population of mutually unconnected multicompartment model neurons with realistic morphologies. We found that a new class of proxies, based on an optimized linear combination of time-shifted AMPA and GABA currents, provided the most accurate estimate of the EEG over a wide range of network states of the point-neuron network. The performance of the new proxies was evaluated under different assumptions about properties of the multicompartment-neuron network, i.e., cell morphologies, distribution of presynaptic inputs and position of the recording electrode. We explored the application of a convolutional neural network (CNN) as an alternative approach to predict the EEG from synaptic currents. The substantial increase in complexity of the CNN provided a minimum improvement of the estimation performance showed by linear proxies. Our results can be used to easily calculate a biologically realistic EEG signal directly from point-neuron simulations and thereby facilitate quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental EEG recordings.</p>
