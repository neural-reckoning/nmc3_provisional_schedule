        <h1>Multiscale low-dimensional neural dynamics underlie naturalistic reach-and-grasp movements</h1><h2>Hamidreza Abbaspourazad</h2><h3>Hamidreza Abbaspourazad, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California; Mahdi Choudhary, Center for Neural Science, New York University; Yan T Wong, Department of Physiology, Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University; Bijan Pesaran, Center for Neural Science, New York University; Maryam M Shanechi, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Neuroscience Graduate Program, University of Southern California</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Studies of low-dimensional dynamics of neural population activity have largely focused on analyses of spiking activity of a population of neurons. However, motor function involves multiple spatiotemporal scales of brain activity ranging from small-scale processes measured by spiking activity to larger-scale brain network activity reflected in local field potentials (LFP). How low-dimensional dynamics of spiking and LFP activity relate to each other remains elusive to date. Further, for naturalistic reach-and-grasp movements, low-dimensional neural dynamics are relatively under-explored even for spiking population activity. We learn novel multiscale latent state-space models for spiking, LFP and combined spike-LFP activities recorded from non-human primates performing a naturalistic reach-and-grasp movement to diverse locations in 3D space and continuously in time without a trial structure. We partitioned the latent state into several dynamical modes, each characterized with a unique decay-frequency pair which described how fast neural dynamics decayed in time and with what frequency they ringed over time. We then quantified how predictive of behavior each mode was. In both spiking and LFP network activity, there existed a mode that was dominantly predictive of behavior compared to other modes. Interestingly, while spiking and LFP network activity displayed several distinct modes, this predictive mode was shared between them, i.e. had similar decay-frequency characteristics. This implied that the predictive mode was multiscale. Interestingly, the multiscale predictive mode was also shared across sessions and monkeys, but was not simply a replicate of modes in behavior. Finally, the multiscale predictive mode existed in both low-frequency and high-frequency LFP bands. Multiple convergent analysis showed that both the multiscale predictive mode’s decay and frequency explained naturalistic behavior. The predictive mode’s time-decay was ~1s, which was longer than all other modes, suggesting that naturalistic behavior relies on integrating multiscale neural dynamics over longer time-periods. In addition, its frequency was ~0.2 Hz, characterizing how fast the underlying neural dynamics tended to rotate in time. We propose that multiscale, low-dimensional motor cortical dynamics underlie naturalistic reach-and-grasp movements due to the prominent role of large-scale brain networks in these movements.</p>
