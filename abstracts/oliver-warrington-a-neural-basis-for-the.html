        <h1>A neural basis for the enhancement of domain-general metacognition.</h1><h2>Oliver Warrington</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Metacognition refers to an ability to reflect on, monitor and control cognitive performance. An individual with good metacognitive sensitivity tracks fluctuations in task performance, and appropriately modulates their confidence levels (e.g. holding higher confidence when correct, and lower confidence when incorrect).

Though metacognitive abilities have typically been treated as fixed characteristics, we recently found that 8 sessions of web-based metacognitive training on a perceptual discrimination task led to selective increases in confidence and metacognitive sensitivity (Carpenter et al., 2019). This change in metacognition generalised to an untrained memory task, despite first-order performance remaining stable. This experiment revealed the malleability of both confidence and insight, and suggests the possibility for long-term enhancement of metacognitive abilities. However, no study has examined how training impacts upon the neural correlates of perceptual or memory metacognition.

In the current experiment, participants underwent a similar internet-based training protocol as the previous behavioural study along with functional and stuctural MRI scans pre- and post-training. Behavioural results indicate domain-general changes in both confidence and metacognitive sensitivity, replicating the results of the previous study and supporting evidence for the possibility of training metacognition. In our presentation we will describe behavioural results together with preliminary results examining the impact of training on confidence-related activations recorded using 3T fMRI.</p>
