        <h1>Conserved core visual object recognition across simian primates: Marmoset image-by-image behavior mirrors that of humans and macaques</h1><h2>Alex Kell</h2><h3>Alexander J.E. Kell, Columbia University; Sophie L. Bokor, Columbia University; You-Nah Jeon, Columbia University; Tahereh Toosi, Columbia University; Elias B. Issa, Columbia University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Introduced to the field decades ago, marmosets have become an increasingly popular model organism in neuroscience. Among the smallest simian primates, marmosets offer features typically associated with rodents in a species that is phylogenetically closer to humans—e.g., small size (~300 g), flat cortex, and relatively high fecundity. Marmosets may therefore mitigate traditional compromises between an animal model’s methodological tractability and its similarity to humans. Nonetheless, there remain serious concerns that, simian or not, marmosets’ perceptual and cognitive repertoire may be rather limited, particularly in higher-level perception and cognition. Here, we assessed the advanced perceptual abilities of the marmoset in a quintessential domain of systems neuroscience: vision. We quantitatively compared the behavior of three simian primates—marmosets, humans, and macaques—during core visual object recognition, the invariant identification of objects on natural backgrounds despite changes in object scale, position, and pose. We selected this behavior to benchmark the marmoset because it captures a crux problem in natural vision and is computationally challenging. We found that marmosets achieved impressively high performance on this core recognition task, and that their image-by-image behavior was remarkably human-like—indeed, nearly as human-like as was macaques’ (marmoset-human correlation, r = 0.73; macaque-human correlation, r = 0.77). Critically, these kinds of high-level visual behaviors did not seem to extend to rodents—we found that marmosets’ visual capabilities far outstripped those of rats on a simplified object recognition task. Thus, aspects of core high-level perception appear to be shared across simian primates, and marmosets may therefore offer a powerful platform for the study of capabilities conventionally considered to be the exclusive purview of larger primates. </p>
