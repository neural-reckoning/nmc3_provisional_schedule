        <h1>Microsurgical lesions identify segmentally distinct responses of axotomized corticospinal neurons</h1><h2>Carolin Ruven</h2><h3>Vibhu Sahni, Ph.D.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>It remains well established that the intrinsic ability of neurons for axon regeneration declines with age. Despite significant work, we still do not precisely know how and when do neurons lose this intrinsic ability during development. This is because conventional models of injury produce an injury response and disrupt potential guidance cues required for axon growth. Such models cannot therefore precisely delineate the intrinsic ability of neurons for axon regrowth. We aimed to investigate intrinsic ability of axonal regeneration during development, at a time when appropriate guidance cues are still expressed in their appropriate context. To this end, we have established a novel, reproducible, approach to transect developing corticospinal neuron (CSN) axons in the neonatal spinal cord. In this new approach, the corticospinal tract (CST) is injured using a beveled micropipette vibrating at ultrasonic frequency. This results in minimal glial scarring, inflammation and leaves the spinal environment largely unperturbed. This therefore enables a clear, unambiguous investigation of the intrinsic ability of axon regeneration through development. Our results surprisingly indicate that CSN axon regenerative ability is not lost uniformly across the different segments of the same axon. Specifically, CSN axons injured at postnatal day 7 (P7) at caudal thoracic T11 can fully regenerate and extend to lumbar segments. In striking contrast, CSN axons, when injured at high cervical C2, at an even earlier time, P4, completely fail to extend across this micro-lesion. This surprising finding indicates that CSN axons lose their regenerative ability at distinct times at distinct spinal segments. This new approach will now enable molecular delineation of specific mechanisms controlling the decline of CSN regenerative ability. Further, this also suggests that distinct therapeutic approaches will be required to target CST regeneration after spinal injuries at different spinal segmental levels. Finally, this novel microsurgical approach can now be used to specifically test whether candidate molecules can increase the intrinsic ability of CSN to extend axons after spinal cord injury.</p>
