        <h1>Trajectories in Cognition Studies - a focus on embodiment and future frontiers</h1><h2>Anson  Lim(he him)</h2><h3>Jesse Parent, Orthogonal Research and Education Lab</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The study of cognition contains a vast set of tributaries flowing from "traditional" fields of cognitive science, particularly philosophy and general inquiries into the nature of the mind. What is missing following the last several decades of the cognitive revolution? In this talk, we look at relevant trajectories in the philosophy behind inquiries into cognitive capacity and functioning. In particular, we look at the concept of embodiment and how it shaped discourse, education, and analysis in studying cognition broadly, and in specific arenas such as cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive science. We also provide guidelines for mapping out the frontier of cognitive studies, particularly examining further integration of embodied & developmental approaches from psychology and biology and their implications for artificial intelligence.</p>
