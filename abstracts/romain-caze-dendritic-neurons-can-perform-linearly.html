        <h1>Dendritic neurons can perform linearly separable computations with low resolution synaptic weights</h1><h2>Romain Caz√©</h2><h3>Marcel Stimberg</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>n theory, neurons modelled as single layer perceptrons can implement all lin-early  separable  computations.   In  practice,  however,  these  computations  mayrequire  arbitrarily  precise  synaptic  weights.   This  is  a  strong  constraint  sinceboth,  biological  neurons  and  their  artificial  counterparts,  have  to  cope  withlimited precision.  Here, we explore how the non-linear processing in dendriteshelps overcoming this constraint.  We start by finding a class of computationswhich requires increasing precision with the number of inputs in a perceptronand show that it can be implemented without this constraint in a neuron withsub-linear subunits.  Then, we complement this analytical study by a simulationof a biophysical neuron model with two passive dendrites and a soma, and showthat it can implement this computation.  This works demonstrates a new role ofdendrites in neural computation:  by distributing the computation across inde-pendent subunits, the same computation can be performed more efficiently withless precise tuning of the synaptic weights.  We hope that this works not only of-fers new insight into the importance of dendrites for biological neurons, but alsopaves  the  way  for  new,  more  efficient  architectures  of  artificial  neuromorphicchips</p>
