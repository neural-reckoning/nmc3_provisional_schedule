        <h1>Attentional Sampling Strategies in Multi-Attribute Decision Making</h1><h2>Jacob Elsey</h2><h3>Jacob Elsey, Johns Hopkins University; Ernst Niebur, Johns Hopkins University; Veit Stuphorn, Johns Hopkins University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Many everyday decisions require us to consider multiple options, each comprised of a number of shared or different attributes. In such situations, optimal decisions require the simultaneous integration and comparison of a large amount of information. This complexity is thought to tax limited cognitive resources, requiring the use of attention to select a limited subset of information, upon which the decision is then based. To better understand the role of attention in decision making, subjects participated in multi-attribute decision making tasks in which we systematically varied the complexity of choices by increasing the number of options, or attributes, or both. Our task design uses eye position as an overt measure of attention while subjects choose between gambles that systematically cover the decision space. Each attribute's magnitude is masked by an opaque disk whose color indicates the attribute type. The attribute value is only revealed when the disk is actively fixated upon. Subjects freely inspect the attributes with no time constraint, before indicating their choice with a keypress. The resulting eye movements provide detailed temporal and spatial information about subjects' focus of attention during the attribute sampling process. <br/><br/>We find that human participants mainly deploy two strategies for sampling decision-related information. When only few options are available, participants most frequently use an exhaustive strategy to sample all attributes of each option independently, before examining the next one (2-Option, 2-Attribute: 68% of subjects, 2-Option, 4-Attribute: 66%). This is an effective strategy because all information is examined. However, when more options are available, participants most commonly employ a filtering strategy. They first compare their most important attribute (which differs between subjects) across all options to identify the one or two best ones, and then sample all attributes of those best options (4-Option, 2-Attribute: 75% of subjects, 4-Option, 4-Attribute: 68%). This strategy reduces the amount of information that needs to be processed but can lead to suboptimal choices. Importantly, which strategy is used depends on the number of options, but not the number of attributes. Thus, increasingly complex decision problems evoke strategic shifts in the direction of attention during the search for the preferred option. Because our new task design provides detailed information over the temporal order of sampling the attributes, it retains the ability to control task requirements typical for laboratory designs, while still capturing important aspects of real-world decision making in complex environments. Thus, this task allows us to explore the neuronal mechanisms underlying the different strategies.</p>
