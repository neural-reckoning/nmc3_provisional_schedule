        <h1>Metabolic state dependence of olfactory cortex flavor representation during binge eating in rodents</h1><h2>Hung Lo (he/him)</h2><h3>Anke Schönherr, Charité; Marion Rivalan, Humboldt University of Berlin; Katharina Stumpenhorst, Humboldt University of Berlin; York Winter, Humboldt University of Berlin; Dietmar Schmitz, Charité; Friedrich Johenning, Charité </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Energy homeostasis is achieved by the complex regulatory network that involves a feedback circuit between dietary intake behavior and nutritional state. The uncoupling of dietary intake and nutritional state results in overeating. Hedonic overeating can escalate into binge eating, a heritable trait associated with binge eating disorder and bulimia. One factor that modulates this feedback loop is the sensory perception of flavors. Olfaction is a critical element of flavor perception and greatly influences the qualitative and hedonic evaluation of food items. Patients with olfactory chemosensory deficits commonly report a reduced appreciation of food items. Current evidence suggests that upon fasting, the olfactory system is necessary for triggering fasting-induced overeating. However, it is unclear how adaptations related to binge eating are reflected by the olfactory flavor responses. 

To understand the relationship between olfactory perception and binging, we developed an overeating behavioral paradigm that repeatedly delivers hedonic food (flavored milk) to mice. Implementing this with a head-mount miniaturized microscope allows us to measure neural responses upon overeating in the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) in freely moving mice. We found that during a binge eating bout, the majority (~90%) of excitatory piriform neurons are suppressed. Whether this implies the involvement of inhibitory neurons during binging and/or whether the flavor representation adapts during the escalation of binging are the next steps of our examination. </p>
