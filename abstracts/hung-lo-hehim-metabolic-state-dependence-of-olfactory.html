        <h1>Metabolic state dependence of olfactory cortex flavor representation during binge eating in rodents</h1><h2>Hung Lo (he/him)</h2><h3>Anke Schönherr, Charité; Marion Rivalan, Humboldt University of Berlin; Katharina Stumpenhorst, Humboldt University of Berlin; York Winter, Humboldt University of Berlin; Dietmar Schmitz, Charité; Friedrich Johenning, Charité </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Energy homeostasis is achieved by the complex regulatory network that involves a feedback circuit between dietary intake behavior and nutritional state. The uncoupling of dietary intake and nutritional state results in overeating. Hedonic overeating can escalate into binge eating, a heritable trait associated with binge eating disorder and bulimia. One factor that modulates this feedback loop is the sensory perception of flavors. Olfaction is a critical element of flavor perception and greatly influences the qualitative and hedonic evaluation of food items. Patients with olfactory chemosensory deficits commonly report a reduced appreciation of food items. Current evidence suggests that upon fasting, the olfactory system is necessary for triggering fasting-induced overeating. However, it is unclear how adaptations related to binge eating are reflected by the olfactory flavor responses. <br/><br/>To understand the relationship between olfactory perception and binging, we developed an overeating behavioral paradigm that repeatedly delivers hedonic food (flavored milk) to mice. Implementing this with a head-mount miniaturized microscope allows us to measure neural responses upon overeating in the olfactory cortex (piriform cortex) in freely moving mice. We found that during a binge eating bout, the majority (~90%) of excitatory piriform neurons are suppressed. Whether this implies the involvement of inhibitory neurons during binging and/or whether the flavor representation adapts during the escalation of binging are the next steps of our examination. </p>
