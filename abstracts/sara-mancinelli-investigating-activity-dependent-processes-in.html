Spatiotemporally coordinated events involving the execution of intrinsic molecular programs and activity-dependent processes contribute to cortical development, and alterations of these delicate processes have been associated to neurological/neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite the recent groundbreaking discovery of spontaneous activity in the embryonic brain, it is still unclear whether early activity contributes to shape subtype-specific neuronal identity. Trough in utero genetic perturbation and pharmacological inhibition of selected ion channels, known to control excitability, we aim at identify the activity-regulated processes controlling the development of different cortical PN classes and their wiring. Our project aims at dissecting the contribution of activity-dependent processes in the acquisition of subtype specific features of developing cortical neurons, trough in vivo genetic manipulation of distinct channels known to be regulator of neuronal excitability and/or associated with developmental epileptic encephalopathy. We are currently combining RNA sequencing technology and in utero experimental activity perturbations, to identify coupled activity and molecular modules involved in cerebral cortex development and disease.  </p>
