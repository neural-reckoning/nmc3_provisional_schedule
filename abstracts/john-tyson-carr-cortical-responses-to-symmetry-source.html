        <h1>Cortical responses to symmetry: Source localisation of the sustained-posterior negativity</h1><h2>John Tyson-Carr</h2><h3>John Tyson-Carr, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK; Marco Bertamini, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK; Giulia Rampone, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK; Alexis D. J. Makin, Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Visual regularity activates a network of brain regions in the extrastriate cortex. Previous EEG studies have found that this response scales parametrically with proportion of symmetry in symmetry + noise displays. The parametric symmetry response happens in many tasks, but it is enhanced when the task requires active regularity discrimination. However, the origins and time course of this selective enhancement are unclear. Here we answered remaining questions with new source dipole analysis in a reanalysis of the data originally reported by Makin et al. (2020). As assumed, the parametric symmetry response found at the sensor level was generated by a pair of dipoles in the left and right extrastriate cortex, a finding comparable with previous fMRI research. This bilateral activity was itself enhanced during regularity discrimination, in accordance with original findings. However, we identified a third, and later, symmetry response in the posterior cingulate during regularity discrimination. The spatial distribution of this component was characterized by a strong positive potential over the vertex of the scalp at approximately 580 ms. Unlike the extrastriate response, this previously unknown activation only indexes strong, task relevant regularity signals. This clarifies the neural circuits which mediate the perceptual and cognitive aspects of symmetry discrimination.</p>
