        <h1>Retinal waves prime visual motion detection by simulating future optic flow</h1><h2>Xinxin Ge</h2><h3>Xinxin Ge, UCSF (formerly at Yale); Kathy Zhang, Yale; Ali Hamodi, Yale; Alex Gribizis, Max Plank Florida Institute for Neuroscience; Aude Martinez Sabino, University of Technology of Compi√®gne </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The ability to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli emerges in the absence of sensory experience. Spontaneous retinal activity prior to eye-opening guides the refinement of retinotopy and eye-specific segregation, but its role in the development of higher order visual response properties remains unclear. Here, we describe a transient developmental window during which the spatial propagation of spontaneous retinal waves resembles the optic flow pattern generated by forward self-motion. We show that wave directionality requires the same circuit components that form the adult direction-selective retinal circuit and that chronic disruption of wave directionality alters the development of direction-selective responses of superior colliculus neurons. These data demonstrate how the developing visual system patterns spontaneous activity to simulate ethologically relevant features of the external world to instruct self-organization.</p>
