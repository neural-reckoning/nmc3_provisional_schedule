        <h1>Automated Screening to Assist a Systematic Living Summary of Primary In Vivo Focal Cerebral Ischaemic Stroke Research</h1><h2>Emma Wilson</h2><h3>Florenz Cruz, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin; Joly Ghanawi, Independent Researcher; Jing Liao, University of Edinburgh; Sarah McCann, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin; Malcolm Macleod, University of Edinburgh; Emily Sena, University of Edinburgh</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Introduction: The failure to plan new research based on a systematic assessment of the existing literature is an important source of research waste. Systematic reviews of primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke research have informed improvements in research quality and translation of findings to the clinic[1]. However, the process is time-consuming and, by completion, the results are often out of date. We aim to develop a workflow to automatically identify reports of this research to allow a systematic living summary of the literature[2].
Methods: We trained the machine-learning algorithm using a random sample of PubMed records from a search of terms relevant to focal cerebral ischaemia supplemented with relevant studies identified from previous systematic reviews[3]. In August 2020, we conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Embase and passed the unique studies through the algorithm to identify all primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke research.
Results: Our random sample (N=4,000) identified 130 (3.3%) primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke studies. We trained the machine-learning algorithm with 4,786 studies (4,000 random sample plus 786 identified from previous systematic reviews). The algorithm identified relevant studies with sensitivity at 95%, specificity at 98% and precision at 92%. Our systematic search of PubMed and Embase identified 752,494 unique studies duplicate removal. Of this, the algorithm identified 27,269 (3.6%) primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke studies.
Conclusions: Automated screening of search results in systematic review will save substantial resources, especially where the yield of relevant studies is low. Preliminary machine-learning results suggest that this machine-learning algorithm is highly accurate in identifying primary in vivo focal cerebral ischaemic stroke research and could be used in an automated systematic living summary workflow curating such research.
