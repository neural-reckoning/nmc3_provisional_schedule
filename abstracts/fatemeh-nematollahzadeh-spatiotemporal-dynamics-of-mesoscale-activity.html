        <h1>Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Mesoscale activity in Sensory Cortex</h1><h2>Fatemeh Nematollahzadeh</h2><h3>Mehdi Adibi, Sayed Jalal zahabi, Ehsan Yazdian</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Synchrony in the activity of neuronal circuits is one of the topics of interest in modern systems neuroscience. The Spatiotemporal dynamics of the synchrony in the spontaneous activity at different scales may carry information about the organization, circuitry of neuronal populations as well as the local processes and function of these circuits.
Here, to quantify the extent to which the dynamics of synchronous spontaneous activity predicts the neuroanatomical structure, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) and spiking activity of cluster of neurons in the somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rats in using a 10x10 microelectrode array.
We did the experiments on the somatosensory cortex of awake and anesthetized rodents (rats and mice). We calculated different measures of within and cross-frequency coupling (in terms of phase-phase, phase-amplitude, amplitude-amplitude coupling) in frequency bands of interest (<0.1 Hz, δ, θ, α, β, γ) between pairs of electrodes. We observed a gradual decrease in the strength of coupling with the distance between electrodes, especially at higher frequencies. Specifically, while the decline was not so evident for  <0.1 Hz and δ band, where the couplings varied insignificantly with distance, it became more profound for higher frequencies.
A multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) on the strength of couplings revealed the spontaneous activity predicts the position of electrodes. Applying machine learning based on T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) lead to similar findings.
