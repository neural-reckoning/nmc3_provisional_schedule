        <h1>Cardiac signals modulate visual awareness</h1><h2>Viviana Leupin (Her/She)</h2><h3>Viviana Leupin, Joanna Moret, Juliane Britz</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>We can investigate neural correlates of consciousness by measuring the brain response to different perceptual outcomes of the same stimulus (e.g., sensory threshold stimuli perceived in 50% of trials). Differences in perceptual awareness can arise from i) evoked brain responses for different perceptual outcomes and ii) from the pre-stimulus differences in brain activity. Cyclic variations of bodily signals can also influence perceptual awareness: baroreceptor activity during the systolic phase interferes with sensory stimulus processing, and the pre-stimulus response of the brain to the heartbeat (HEP) differs for stimuli subsequently seen or not. We presented subjects with near-threshold stimuli (Gabors overlaid with random-dot-noise) and compared i) the event related potentials (ERPs) and ii) the HEP for the same stimuli when consciously seen and not. ERPs for seen and unseen differed as a function of cardiac phase: early sensory potentials (P1) were modulated during systole, while later cognitive potentials (VAN) were modulated during diastole. The HEP amplitude, topographic and source space differences indicated that the default-mode-network is recruited for subsequently unseen stimuli and that the saliency-network is recruited for subsequently seen stimuli. Taken together, we show that the cardiac phase and the brain response to the heartbeat can influence conscious awareness at the visual threshold.</p>
