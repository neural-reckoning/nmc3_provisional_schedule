        <h1>EDEN: A high-usability, high-performance, general-purpose neural simulator</h1><h2>Sotirios Panagiotou</h2><h3>Harry Sidiropoulos, Erasmus University Medical Center; George Smaragdos, Erasmus University Medical Center; Mario Negrello, Erasmus University Medical Center; Dimitrios Soudris, National Technical University of Athens; Christos Strydis, Erasmus University Medical Center</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In-silico neuroscience is an important tool to define the conceptual models of neural networks, to deeply explore the emerging features of these models, and to guide subsequent in-vitro and in-vivo experiments.
We present EDEN, a novel neural simulator that can run all types of neural network models in the NeuroML v2.0 specification, and drastically reduces the required simulation time.
There is no model-specific programming required to run the models.
EDEN also performs full validation of the NeuroML models in use, and explains the causes of possible errors.
The simulator setup is integrated with the Python and Docker infrastructure. This way, EDEN can be effortlessly deployed on interactive Python notebooks, for a single person or a whole class.
Simulations are automatically further sped up with multi-core execution within a single PC, or throughout HPC clusters.
This way, even larger and more detailed models can be investigated in a practical timeframe.</p>
