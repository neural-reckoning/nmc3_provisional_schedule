        <h1>The Massive Report Paradigm: Assessing the richness of conscious visual experience</h1><h2>Regan Gallagher</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>To most of us, our experience of the world seems extremely rich in detail. However, some researchers claim this feeling of richness is an illusion. We developed several tasks to estimate the richness of perceptual experiences based on information theory, in an approach we call the “Massive Report” paradigm. First, we simply showed participants (in lab N=10, in MTurk N>600) a brief glimpse (SOA=67, 133 or 267ms before being masked) of one natural scene picture (we used 580 images in total) and asked for 5 nouns/adjectives/verbs that describe the scene. Second, we compiled a large pool of descriptors for the set of images as potential “alternatives” and performed classical discrimination tasks with confidence ratings. The novelty of the paradigm is that we interrogated the phenomenology associated with a single image with a “massive” set of questions (between 20 and 80640 questions per image).  The results of these experiments suggest that subjects can discriminate a huge repertoire of scene characteristics; in information theoretic terms, the bandwidth of differentiation measures at > 1500 bits per second (compared to previous estimates of <40 bits per second). Our results suggest that a moment of experience is much richer than previously considered.</p>
