        <h1>Exploring the role of oxytocin on rats' stress-related behaviours</h1><h2>Kate Zucconi</h2><h3>Janet Menard, Queen's University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Social contact is known to reduce or “buffer” rodents’ responses to acute stress. Although the mechanisms responsible for social buffering remain unclear, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) is thought to play a role. This possibility was explored in the current study. Rats were randomly assigned to either single- or paired-housing, then five weeks later they were tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and a modified version of the novelty-induced suppression of feeding test (NFST). Seven days later, their brains were harvested and processed for OT-labelling. Pair-housed rats displayed moderately higher open-arm exploration in the EPM and took significantly less time to initiate consumption of the snack in the NSFT. Furthermore, compared to single-housed rats, pair-housed rats had significantly more OT-ir cells in the ventral part of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). The number of OT cells in the ventral PVN correlated negatively with their latencies to begin consuming the snack on Day 1 of the NSFT. Overall, these findings suggest that “social buffering” is mediated, at least in part, by social contact-induced remodelling of the OT system. </p>
