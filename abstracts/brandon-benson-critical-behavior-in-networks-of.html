        <h1>Critical behavior in networks of inhibitory-excitatory spiking neurons with weak synaptic efficacy</h1><h2>Brandon Benson</h2><h3>Jonathan Kadmon, Stanford University; Surya Ganguli, Stanford University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Cortical circuits exhibit a rich dynamical behavior with irregular individual neuron firing rates, global oscillations, synchronization, scale-free fluctuations and high sensitivity to certain stimuli. While classical theories of inhibitory and excitatory (IE) neurons explain these behaviors, they require different synaptic properties. The coexistence of the observed behaviors suggests that the network may be operating at a near-critical regime. A recent study by Girardi-Schappo et. al. portrayed the phase space of IE neurons with binary activation, discrete-time dynamics, and stochastic threshold. The binary model presents qualitatively similar states to those of IE spiking neurons and the authors identified a critical point of the Direct Percolation (DP) universality class, namely a transition between an absorbing and an active network state often associated with a critical branching process. However, the existence and nature of the critical point in the case of more realistic spiking dynamics are still at question. In this work, we return the leaky iterate-and-fire (LIF) model, which was studies in the context of IE networks. We study its mean-field dynamics around the proposed critical point. When the total synaptic efficacy is of the order of the threshold -- a limit not previously studied -- stable activity with slow oscillations persists well into the unstable excitatory regime. This slow-oscillations phase is bounded by SNIC and Hopf bifurcation lines which meet at the proposed critical point. We find that along the Hopf bifurcation, the system exhibits scale-free avalanches with sub-critical scaling exponents that conform with in vivo cortical slice preparations. Importantly, we show that the microscopic dynamics cannot be understood as a critical-branching process. We further discuss our results in relation to sensitivity for perturbation, and to recent experiments of in vivo optogenetic perturbations in the visual cortex.</p>
