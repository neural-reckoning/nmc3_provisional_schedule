        <h1>Distinct Cluster of Dopaminergic Input Neurons is necessary to establish larval aversive memory</h1><h2>Denise Weber</h2><h3>Lukas Körner; Andreas S. Thum</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The ability to learn from past events and apply them to future situations can determine life and death of an organism. In 1985, Tully and Quinn showed that even an inconspicuous organism such as adult Drosophila is able to learn situational information and develop memory. Since then, much has been done in this field and Drosophila has been established as a generally valid model organism for learning and memory. In particular, the Drosophila larva offers unexpected advantages: firstly, the availability and robustness of the larvae for behavioral experiments; secondly, the anatomical simplicity of the larval central nervous system, which consists of only about 10,000 neurons; furthermore, the almost unlimited variety of genetic tools which make it possible to activate or silence individual neurons.  All advantages - together with the latest publication of the connectome – make the larva a popular object of choice in neurogenetics. Above all, the insect mushroom body (MB) is a central unit when it comes to sensory input, processing, and behavioral output. It has been shown that the MB consists of eleven compartments, all of which have a limited number of specific neuronal inputs (MBINs) and outputs (MBONs) - these MBINs can be either dopaminergic (DAN), octopaminergic (OAN), or of unknown identity. Here, we analyzed different mushroom body input neurons to test their significance in salt-dependent aversive classical olfactory conditioning by using the Split-GAL4-UAS system to ablate MBINs at cellular resolution. Our results reveal that an aversive salt-dependent memory is not formed by a single input neuron, rather by an integral network of input neurons in the vertical lobe of the mushroom body. </p>
