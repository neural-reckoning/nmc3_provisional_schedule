        <h1>Finger stability in precision grips</h1><h2>Neelima Sharma (she/her)</h2><h3>Neelima Sharma, Yale University; Madhusudhan Venkadesan, Yale University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Stable precision grips underlie human hand dexterity. However, multi-link chains like our fingers are inherently prone to the mechanical instability of buckling, where the finger snaps into a hyper-extended posture when applying tip forces. How the neuromuscular control suppresses buckling instabilities in healthy fingers remains unknown. Using experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that human fingers maintain stability by using an open-loop strategy based on muscle stiffness, rather than sensorimotor feedback. In an experiment, we instructed people to maximize their index fingertip's forces in self-selected postures. The occasional buckling events were too fast for neural feedback control to stabilize, suggesting that stable finger postures rely on muscle stiffness. However, using a biomechanical model of the index finger activated by seven muscles, we found that muscle stiffness is also insufficient for stable grips at maximal forces unless we add extra stiffness to stabilize the finger joints. We tested this prediction in 23 subjects. Attaching a stiffening splint to the finger increased the maximal force by 69±14% and total muscle electromyography readings from two flexors by 85±23% compared to the finger without splint (mean±standard error). Therefore, people do not apply their true maximal force unless extra stiffness allows their muscles to apply higher force without compromising stability. We calculated the viable space of muscle activities that satisfy the finger's equilibrium and stability constraints using the biomechanical model. The viable activation patterns lie within a six-dimensional convex hyperplane that is embedded in the seven-dimensional space of normalized muscle activations. Within this viable space, muscle co-contraction could stabilize submaximal but not maximal forces. More stiffness aids stability but compromises compliance, essential for the adaptive grasping of complex objects geometries. Thus, we show how the interaction between finger mechanics and neural control of muscle stiffness affects hand function.</p>
