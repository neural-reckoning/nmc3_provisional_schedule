Malfunction of 5-HT system also involved in depression, addiction, compulsivity and other neurological disorders. One major obstacle to understand the physiological regulation of 5-HT is lack of sensitive methods to decipher the dynamics of 5-HT non-invasively with good cell specificity and high spatiotemporal  resolution, especially in vivo. Here, we developed a series of genetically-encoded 5-HT sensors by coupling cpEGFP or cpmApple with 5-HT receptors. Upon 5-HT binding, the chimeric receptor changes its conformation which leads to a subsequent fluorescent signal increase from the embedded cpEGFP or cpmApple , therefore reporting 5-HT. We named this kind of sensors â€œthe GPCR Activation Based sensors for 5-HT, short for GRAB5-HT. With iterative engineering, we developed a series of GRAB5-HT sensors with high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrated GRAB5-HT sensors could be applied in multiple organisms, including Drosophila, mice and monkey for reliable detection of 5-HT in vivo. Thus, this tool would enhance our understanding of complex neuromodulation both in health and in diseases.<br/></p>
