        <h1>I would have found it by now: Metacognitive contributions to search termination</h1><h2>Matan Mazor</h2><h3>Stephen M. Fleming</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>When searching for a target object among distractors, a robust finding in cognitive science is that search time varies as a function of the number of distractors and their similarity to the target object. This is true not only for the time taken to say a target is present, but also for the time taken to terminate a search and conclude that a target object is absent. However, while models of visual search have successfully characterized contributions to target detection (such as salience or pop-out), the mechanisms underpinning when to terminate a search and conclude that a target is absent are poorly understood. In other words, when do people decide to give up and conclude that nothing is there? One hypothesis is that efficient search termination involves metacognitive knowledge such as the expected difficulty of the search, target salience, or fluctuations in one’s attentional state. By focusing on the first few trials in a visual search task in a large online sample, here we control participants’ ability to base their search termination on metacognitive knowledge before engaging with the task, and to directly measure the effect of experience on the shaping of this knowledge. In a first pilot experiment (N=181), we find a qualitative change in search termination efficiency before and after experiencing finding a target, in line with a metacognitive learning account.</p>
