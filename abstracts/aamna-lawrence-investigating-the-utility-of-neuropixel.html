        <h1>Investigating the utility of neuropixel probes for studying the vestibular nuclei</h1><h2>Aamna Lawrence</h2><h3>Hui Ho Vanessa Chang; Kathleen Cullen</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Understanding neural circuits and how they generate behavior and perception critically depends on the accurate measurements of neuronal activity. Rapid progress in semiconductor technology has led to the development of high-definition silicon probes with many densely packed sites that provide high spatial resolution for electrical measurements. However, to date, no study has employed them in probing deep subcortical brain regions, like the brainstem.  In our present study, we were, for the first time, able to successfully isolate single units in the vestibular nuclei using chronically-implanted Neuropixel IMEC 3B probes with 960 recording sites in head-restrained mice. The probe was positioned in the brain, such that there were approximately 112 recording sites in the medial vestibular nuclei. Spike sorting algorithms, namely, Kilosort2 and JRClust, were used for isolating the units. In total, we were able to isolate up to ten head movement-sensitive neurons by passively moving the head using the vestibular ocular reflex paradigm. The units showed robust head velocity sensitivity and no sensitivity for eye position and eye velocity during the static eye position and optokinetic reflex evoking paradigms, as inferred from their firing rates. The head velocity sensitivity (0.25 ± 0.12 (sp/s) / (deg/s)) and the baseline firing rate (18.56 ± 9.03 sp/s) of the neurons agreed with those reported by Beraneck and Cullen (2007) using tungsten microelectrodes. Moreover, our analysis of isolated units provided consistent results across both the above-mentioned spike sorting software. Overall, our results highlight the neuropixel probe’s success to investigate deep brain regions and simultaneously record many single units, thereby extending our ability to probe these circuits beyond the capabilities of the conventional tungsten and glass microelectrodes. The future direction of the study is to use the neuropixel probes for recording from head-free mice to understand the neuronal encoding of active movement in the vestibular nuclei. </p>
