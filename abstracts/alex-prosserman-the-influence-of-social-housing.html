        <h1>The Influence of Social Housing and Housing Air Pressure on Rats’ Anxiety-Related Behaviour</h1><h2>Alex  Prosserman </h2><h3>Janet Menard; Samantha Irwin; Emma Littler </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Research facilities are increasingly adopting individually ventilated cages (IVCs), a standardized caging system to improve rodents’ wellbeing. IVCs may alter well-characterized displays of rodent behaviour, which poses a unique concern for psychological research. It was not previously known if IVCs alter the anxiety reducing effects of social-housing in rats. Thus, this study examined whether social-housing produced anxiety reducing effects on Long-Evans rats housed in IVCs, as indexed by their behaviour in a Modified Novelty-Induced Suppression of Feeding Test (NSFT) and the density of their oxytocin-labelled cells in the hypothalamus. This study further investigated whether maintaining the IVCs under positive or negative air pressure influenced the rats’ behavioural and neuroanatomical outcomes. It was predicted that single-housing and positive air pressure would increase the rats’ latencies to initiate snack consumption in the NSFT and reduce the density of their oxytocin-labelled cells in the hypothalamus, suggesting increased anxiety-like behaviour. Surprisingly, there was no evidence that social housing influenced the rats’ latencies to initiate snack consumption across the habituation or test trials. However, there was a marked and unexpected main effect of air pressure such that the rats housed under negative air pressure took longer to bite the palatable snack than those housed under positive air pressure. Finally, single-housed rats under positive air pressure displayed more oxytocin-labelled cells in the PaPo of the hypothalamus. These results suggest that IVCs can alter the well-characterized anxiety reducing effect of social housing in laboratory rodents, and might influence other well-characterized displays of rodent behaviour. </p>
