        <h1>Sensorimotor adaptation by task-irrelevant feedback</h1><h2>Kunlin Wei</h2><h3> Kunlin Wei, Yajie Liu, Wanyin Jiang, Yuqing Bi</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Learning by doing is the first tenet of sensorimotor learning. Some motor learning methods, e.g., observational learning, circumvent physical practice of actions, but they still demand deliberate mental simulation of to-be-learned actions with the aid of task-relevant feedback. Here we demonstrate that people can obtain long-term learning in a sensorimotor adaptation task based on task-irrelevant feedback. Participants were required to control a hand-cursor to reach to a target while ignoring a directionally-deviated cursor (the double cursor) moving simultaneously with the hand. Participants were able to suppress this task-irrelevant cursor's influence and perform the task without any sign of implicit learning or adaptive strategy. However, in delayed retention tests, they adapted significantly faster to a standard visuomotor rotation perturbation than na√Øve controls. Participants also showed this saving effect if the double cursor moved in the opposite direction of the visuomotor rotation in the retention test, if it moved with a random direction, or if it moved in mirror-symmetrical directions (mirror reaching is widely regarded as a skill acquisition task). Thus, given that the effect is direction-invariant and across-task, it appears that participants abstract the spatial relationship of visuomotor rotation from the double cursor. They did not show any implicit learning or explicit strategy initially, and their savings was supported only by the faster formation of explicit motor strategies.  Furthermore, we found no saving effect if the double cursor was not directionally deviated but amplitude scaled to the actual hand movement, further collaborating that people deduce an angular concept from the task-irrelevant feedback. Hence, sensorimotor adaptation can be facilitated without deliberate practice and without overt behavioral measures such as explicit strategy or aftereffect. While sensorimotor adaptation is widely considered as a combination of explicit strategy and implicit adaptation, our findings suggest that the motor concept, perhaps a third component, might affect adaptation.</p>
