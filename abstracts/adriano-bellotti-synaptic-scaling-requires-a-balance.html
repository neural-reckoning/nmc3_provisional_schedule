        <h1>Synaptic scaling requires a balance between stability, efficiency, and accuracy in realistic neuron morphologies </h1><h2>Adriano Bellotti</h2><h3>Adriano Bellotti, University of Cambridge; Saeed Aljaberi, University of Cambridge; Fulvio Forni, University of Cambridge; Timothy O’Leary, University of Cambridge;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Synaptic scaling is a homeostatic normalization mechanism that preserves relative synaptic strengths by adjusting them with a common factor.  This multiplicative change is believed to be critical, since synaptic strengths are involved in learning and memory retention.  Further, this homeostatic process is thought to be crucial for neuronal stability, playing a stabilizing role in otherwise runaway Hebbian plasticity.  Synaptic scaling requires a mechanism to sense total neuron activity and globally adjust synapses to achieve some activity set-point. This process is relatively slow, which places limits on its ability to stabilize network activity.  We show that this slow response is inevitable in realistic neuronal morphologies. Furthermore, we reveal that global scaling can in fact be a source of instability unless responsiveness or scaling accuracy are sacrificed.

A neuron with tens of thousands of synapses must regulate its own excitability to compensate for changes in input.  The time requirement for global feedback can introduce critical phase lags in a neuron’s response to perturbation.  Realization of the phase lag instability requires a unified model of synaptic scaling, regulation, and transport.  We present such a model with global and local feedback in realistic neuron morphologies.  This combined model shows that neurons face a tradeoff between stability, accuracy, and efficiency.  Global feedback is required for synaptic scaling but favors either system stability or efficiency.  Large receptor pools improve scaling accuracy in large morphologies but worsen both stability and efficiency.  Local feedback improves the stability-efficiency tradeoff at the cost of scaling accuracy.  This project introduces unexplored constraints on neuron size, morphology, and synaptic scaling.  We describe the interplay between global and local feedback mechanisms required to balance accurate synaptic scaling with neuron stability.  </p>
