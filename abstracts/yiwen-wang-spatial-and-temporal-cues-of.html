        <h1>Spatial and temporal cues of a stem cell direct the circuit partnership in Drosophila larval nerve cord</h1><h2>Yiwen Wang</h2><h3>Yi-wen Wang, University of Chicago; Christopher C. Wreden, University of Chicago, Jake Henderson, University of Chicago, Maayan Levy-Bar, University of Chicago; Jason L Mac-Lean, University of Chicago; Ellie S Heckscher, University of Chicago</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>One of the long-lasting questions in the neuroscience field of is how circuits assemble starting from the level of neuronal stem cells. It is well-established that a small pool of stem cells generates widely diverse neurons through programs of gene expressionâ€”including spatial and temporal patterning. In contrast, how the spatial and temporal cues affect circuit assembly is poorly understood. This information will improve stem-cell based therapeutics for repair of damaged CNS tissue. In this study, we examine stem cell derived spatial and temporal cues in neurons that synapses with each other by determining their stem cell origin and neuronal birth timing. We use the Drosophila larval motor system as a model, focusing specifically on the neurons derived from neuronal stem cell NB3-3 and their presynaptic neurons. We applied electron microscopic connectome annotation of synaptic partnerships and advanced molecular genetic lineage tracing. Specifically, we characterize input connectivity for each neuron of NB3-3, and then determine stem cell origin and neuronal birth timing of both NB3-3 neurons and nerve cord interneurons that synapse onto NB3-3 neurons. The impact of this study is three fold. 1) It provides tools that will enable researchers to infer developmental origin of neurons in the Drosophila larval nerve cord. 2) It establishes NB3-3 as a powerful model system to study circuit assembly. 3) It suggests that the integration of spatial and temporal patterning information provides guidance for interneuron synaptic partnerships. Ultimately, our study revealed that the programs of gene expression known to promote neuronal diversity also regulate circuit wiring.
