        <h1>Spatial connectivity matches direction selectivity in visual cortex</h1><h2>L. Federico Rossi</h2><h3>Kenneth D. Harris; Matteo Carandini</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The selectivity of neuronal responses arises from the architecture of excitatory and inhibitory connections. In primary visual cortex, the selectivity of layer 2/3 neurons for stimulus orientation and direction is thought to arise from similarly-selective intracortical inputs. A neuron’s excitatory inputs, however, can have diverse stimulus preferences, and inhibitory inputs can be promiscuous and unselective. We revealed that excitatory and inhibitory intracortical connections to a layer 2/3 neuron accord with its selectivity by obeying precise spatial patterns. We used rabies tracing to label and functionally image the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to individual pyramidal neurons of mouse visual cortical layer 2/3. Presynaptic excitatory neurons spanned layers 2/3 and 4 and were distributed coaxial to the postsynaptic neuron’s preferred orientation, favouring the region opposite to its preferred direction. By contrast, presynaptic inhibitory neurons resided within layer 2/3 and favoured locations near the postsynaptic neuron and ahead of its preferred direction. The direction selectivity of a postsynaptic neuron was unrelated to the selectivity of presynaptic neurons but correlated with the spatial displacement between excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic ensembles. Similar asymmetric connectivity establishes direction selectivity in the retina, suggesting that this circuit motif might be canonical in sensory processing.<br/>We are currently discovering similar patterns in the morphological reconstructions of the postsynaptic neurons, whose dendritic trees extended preferentially along the neurons’ preferred orientation. These results suggest a link between the dendritic architecture and the function of V1 neurons: by extending towards the appropriate inputs, dendrites may provide a morphological substrate for the emergence of visual selectivity.<br/><br/></p>
