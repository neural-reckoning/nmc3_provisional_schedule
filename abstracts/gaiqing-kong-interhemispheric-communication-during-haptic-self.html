        <h1>Interhemispheric communication during haptic self-perception</h1><h2>Gaiqing Kong</h2><h3>Gaiqing Kong, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UK; Miruna Nitu, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UK; Antonio Cataldo, Institute of Philosophy, University of London, UK; Hiroaki Gomi, NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Japan; Patrick Haggard, UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UK.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>When people move their finger across a planar surface, a slight resistance that decreases movement velocity is illusorily perceived as a bump on the surface. If the surface touched is one’s own skin, a bump should also increase the pressure from the finger to the skin surface. Participants made two movements of the right hand while holding a haptic force-control robot. Resistances were added to both, and participants judged “which movement felt more bumpy; first or second?”. The movements were transferred to a second, slave robot, delivering but task-irrelevant stroking touch to the left forearm. The slave robot briefly increased or decreased tactile pressure in synchrony with right hand velocity decrease, consistent with encountering bumps, or holes respectively (blocked factor), during self-touch. We investigated whether left tactile events changes would bias judgement of the bump size perceived with the right hand. Left tactile pressure increases and decreases both increased bump size perceived by the right hand. Tactile information was thus transferred inter-hemispherically, but the sign of tactile information was not respected. In experiment 2, randomising (rather than blocking) tactile pressure increases/decreases abolished these biases. Inter-hemispheric transfer during self-touch is based on consistent models of synchronized events, but omits geometric object information.</p>
