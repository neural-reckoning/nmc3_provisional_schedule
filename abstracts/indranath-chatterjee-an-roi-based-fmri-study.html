        <h1>An ROI-based fMRI Study of Schizophrenia for Identification of Affected Brain Regions</h1><h2>Indranath Chatterjee</h2><h3>Lea Baumg√§rtner, Hochschule der Medien, University of Applied Science, Stuttgart - 70569, Germany;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Schizophrenia, a severe psychological disorder, is very prevalent in the world. The research on schizophrenia using machine learning techniques and neuroimaging is an active area of study. The functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) helps to identify the brain activity in voxels, consisting of measured changes in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals over time. Based on the fMRI data of 34 schizophrenia patients and 34 healthy controls, we performed a Region of Interest (ROI) study on the identified brain regions for studying hundreds of literature over the last 30 years. Besides, we parcellate the brain into four levels of hierarchy, Hemisphere, Gyrus, Lobes, and Cell type (Broadmann Areas). We applied statistical feature selection techniques, such as t-test and Pearson's Correlation on the preprocessed data to identify the significant regions in each level. The selected features were used for training several machine learning classifiers to analyze the prediction performance of affected brain regions. As for the machine learning approach, we used various classifiers such as K-nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Extreme Learning Machines. We achieved the highest classification accuracy of around 84 % on the Pearson's correlation selected Lobe's data, 84 % on the Broadmann areas' data, and similarly 81 % on the Gyrus data and Hemisphere data. Furthermore, we performed backtracking of the statistically significant selected features and visualized them better to understand the affected brain areas in schizophrenia patients. The reviewed papers depicted region-wise changes in schizophrenia confirm our findings. With the result of our work, we examined the previous research conclusions on an ROI-based approach. Also, we found some affected brain regions, which were never reported before in the literature on schizophrenia. These new findings may open up a possible way of understanding schizophrenia patients' brains from different perspectives. </p>
