        <h1>Recurrent Neural Networks reveal distinct signal flow in mouse visual cortex following expectation violations</h1><h2>Akul Gupta</h2><h3>Farzaneh Najafi</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A prominent theory in neuroscience has been the predictive coding theory, where top-down inputs provide predictions, which are compared with the bottom-up sensory inputs. Predictions are subsequently updated if they deviate from the actual sensory inputs (Rao & Ballard, 1999). To investigate the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie predictive coding, we need to study brain area interactions while animal’s predictions are violated. To this end, we used Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN’s) to analyze cortical layer and area interactions during a visual task, which involved expectation violations.

In brief, Multiplane Mesoscopes were used to simultaneously image 4 cortical depths of 2 visual areas (V1 and LM), while mice performed an image-change detection task. Three mouse lines, which were tagged for excitatory and two inhibitory subpopulations (VIP and SST), were used in our study. The behavioral task involved repeated and regular presentation of images (expected events), as well as the following two unexpected events: 1) infrequent and random omissions of the visual stimulus; 2) presentation of a novel image set after several days of training with a different (familiar) image set.

We fit the activity of units in an RNN model to the activity of individual neurons (Andalman et al., 2019) to study how unexpected events modify signal flow between cortical layers and areas. By comparing the weight distributions of RNN units, we demonstrate that functional connectivity between visual areas and layers changes following the presentation of novel images. Furthermore, functional connectivity was differentially modified for excitatory and inhibitory cell types.

Overall, our results demonstrate the use of RNN’s to investigate the cortical circuitries that underlie the representation and updating of prediction signals.</p>
