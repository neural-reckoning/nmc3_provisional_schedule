        <h1>Metabolic syndrome effect on olfactory function, memory and neurodegenerative processes in rats</h1><h2>Pedro  Clavel</h2><h3>Bryan V. Phillips-Farfán, Instituto Nacional de Pediatría</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline. The main symptom is memory loss but clinical evidence shows that olfactory dysfunction can occur years before any cognitive symptoms. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is an important risk factor for AD development. Experimental research has shown that insulin resistance and oxidative stress (a core MS dysfunction) promote the amyloidogenic pathway, leading to the development of neuritic plaques characteristic of AD. Whether these alterations participate on olfactory dysfunction is still unknown. We evaluated olfactory and memory function, explored insulin pathway activation, amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, lipid peroxidation and neurodegenerative processes in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus using an MS model induced by a high carbohydrate diet. We found olfactory dysfunction in rats that ate a high carbohydrate diet, but interestingly memory appeared to be better in this group Systemic hyperinsulinemia hyper-activated the insulin pathway and APP was downregulated in the hippocampus. Nonetheless, these effects were not observed in the olfactory bulb, as insulin activation and APP expression remained unchanged. Malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation marker, was decreased in the hippocampus and unchanged in the olfactory bulb. We did not find neurodegeneration in these tissues. These results provide novel information about olfactory function in a model of MS induced by high carbohydrate. We propose that insulin resistance showed a differential effect in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, which could account for the results.</p>
