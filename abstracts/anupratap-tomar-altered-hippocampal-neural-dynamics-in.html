McHugh, Laboratory for Circuit &amp; Behavioral Physiology, RIKEN Center for Brain Science, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama, Japan 351-0021</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Adverse effects of chronic stress include anxiety, depression, and learning and memory deficits. Some of these deficits are mediated by stress-induced impaired hippocampal functionality at multiple levels of neural organization including dendritic shrinkage and neurogenesis and impaired synaptic plasticity. In agreement, studies in awake behaving rodents have reported that chronic stress alters place cell activity and disrupts global remapping which is the generation of distinct representations (place maps) across different surroundings. Surprisingly, it is not known if and how chronic stress alters hippocampal information processing during offline behaviour states, including quiet wakefulness/sleep, during which information consolidation takes place during sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs or ripples), high frequency (100-200 Hz) oscillatory events  in the CA1 region.<br/>Here, we employed tetrode recordings in mice and subjected them to chronic immobilization stress (CIS), a well-established rodent model of chronic stress and assessed pyramidal cell activity and SPW-Rs in the dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus. Contrary to our expectations, we noticed a net decrease in pyramidal cell activity during the first exposure to a stress compared to the prior quiet wakefulness/sleep state. We also noticed lower firing rates and decreased participation by pyramidal cells during SPW-Rs, though pyramidal cell co-activity was enhanced during stress exposure. Interestingly, after repeated exposure to same stress, some of these stress-phenotypes were noticed during the rest-state on the last day of CIS, when no overt stress was delivered. These data indicate that repeated exposure to stress alters hippocampal neural dynamics and that disrupted ripple-spike interactions may underlie the impaired learning observed in chronically stressed subjects. <br/></p>
