        <h1>The Parameter Mapping Relationship between LIF Model and Artificial Neuron Model</h1><h2>Lu Sijia</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Brain science and cognitive neuroscience have always been considered one of the important sources of inspiration to machine learning algorithms. Although the performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) can reach the human level on many specific tasks, the strong dependence on labeled data and uninterpretability have been hindering its development. In this regard, many methods were proposed, including the spiking neural networks(SNNs), which are considered to be the third generation of neural network. 

As a brain-inspired network, SNNs has the information transmission mechanism, the processing mechanism closer to the brain, and the lower energy consumption. In recent years, in addition to Hebbian learning mechanism, a supervised learning algorithm using backward propagation has also been proved. However, it does not exceed the effect of ANNs in practical application, especially in the field of target detection and target recognition. Our main objectives are as follows: 1. Establish a connection mechanism between ANNs and SNNs, analyze the differences between the two networks, and narrow the gap between the two networks in practical applications; 2. Extend the local unsupervised learning mechanism to the multi-layer network learning mechanism, and establish a deep network structure; 3. Solve the problem of 'vanishing forward-spike propagation' in deep spiking neural networks. we believe that analyzing the relationship between Leaky Integrate-and-fire (LIF) and artificical neuron model (AN), the basic units of SNNs and ANNs, is the key to solve problems. A parameter mapping is given between LIF and AN, which is verified both theoretically and by simulation analyses for various cases, from a single neuron to a three-layer neural network.</p>
