        <h1>Violence, Neuroscience, and the Legal System</h1><h2>Jozsef Meszaros</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Long before then-President Barack Obama launched the BRAIN initiative, his predecessor George H.W. Bush designated the 1990's as a "Decade of the Brain".  As neuroscientists, we can marvel at the tremendous breadth of discovery and innovation that has taken place within our field over these past three decades. But to what extent have the fruits of our labor been absorbed by the social and political systems which fostered them so closely? In a 2010 Supreme Court decision that forbid the lifetime imprisonment of juveniles for non-homicide crimes, the Court tipped its hat in the direction of developmental brain science. A handful of optimistic observers viewed the decision as heralding a new age of brain-based challenges to our conventional notions of criminal responsibility. Yet, this reality has yet to materialize and there is little to suggest that we can expect otherwise. In this talk, I will briefly discuss the short history of neuroscience and law. Then I will outline a few basic premises of how the legal system treats violent offenses. Finally, I will discuss work in which I have argued that neuroscience evidence of brain insults -- such as physical injury or lead intoxication -- should be used to reduce criminal responsibility for violent acts. Specifically, I will critically reflect on my previous scholarship pertaining to victims of battering relationships who are themselves accused of having participated in criminal conduct. A key question is: "Why should I be responsible for my brain's output if another person has disrupted its function in a way that made me more likely to be violent?" At the core of my argument is a concept of a malleable brain -- regardless of age -- and a notion of guilt that can be distributed to third-parties who disrupt that brain's ability to direct actions within the confines of the law.</p>
