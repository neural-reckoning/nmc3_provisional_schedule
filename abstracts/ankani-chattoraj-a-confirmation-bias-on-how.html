        <h1>A confirmation bias on how humans actively sample sensory information</h1><h2>Ankani Chattoraj</h2><h3>Ankani Chattoraj*, University of Rochester; Sabyasachi Shivkumar*, University of Rochester; Ra Yong Soo, University of Rochester; Katherine Moon, University of Rochester; Ralf Haefner, University of Rochester</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>We interpret visual scenes by making eye-movements to different locations to accumulate evidence. Recent work (Yang et al. 2016) showed that humans make goal driven eye-movements in a gaze contingent paradigm of a visual categorization task so as to maximize information about the correct category. Other studies investigating temporal integration of information in the absence of eye-movement have shown that humans are often biased to overweigh early evidence (“primacy effect”, Nienborg et al. 2009, Kiani et al 2008, Lange et al. 2020). We recently showed that a perceptual confirmation bias drives this effect and arises from approximate online inference in a hierarchical model in which expectations influence sensory inferences (Lange et al. 2020). In this study, we investigated whether similar biases exist due to biased eye-movements. Are saccades to peripheral stimuli biased by existing beliefs about the correct category? 
To test this hypotheses, we designed two 2AFC experiments. In Experiment 1, the subject first fixated on a band passed gabor stimulus either oriented +45 degrees or -45 degrees while two or three stimuli (fixed per trial, random across trials) appeared in the periphery and the subject had to saccade to one of them. After three such saccades, the subject had to report the orientation in majority. In Experiment 2, a subject saw 18 black horizontal/vertical ellipses on a gray background and made eye-movements freely for 1.5 secs before choosing the orientation in majority.

In both experiments we found evidence that subjects are biased to saccade to targets that confirm their belief about the correct category. The pattern of subject responses can be explained by an approximate inference model of information maximization (extending Yang et al. 2016).
