        <h1>Energy landscape analysis of EEG of Alzheimer’s patients reveals alterations of state transitions dynamics</h1><h2>Dominik Klepl (He/his)</h2><h3>Fei He, Coventry University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases with around 30 million patients worldwide. Accessible and non-invasive methods of diagnosing and characterising AD are therefore desirable. Electroencephalography (EEG) fulfils these criteria and is often used when studying AD. Several features derived from EEG were shown to be able to predict AD with high accuracies, e.g. signal complexity and synchronisation. However, the dynamics of how the brain transitions between stable states have not been properly studied in case of AD and EEG data. Energy landscape analysis is a method that can be used to quantify these dynamics. This work presents the first application of this method to both AD and EEG. Energy landscape assigns energy value to each possible state, i.e. pattern of activations. The energy is inversely proportional to probability of occurrence. Therefore, high energy states have low probability of occurrence. Studying the features of energy landscapes of 20 AD patients and their healthy age-matched counterparts, significant differences were found. The dynamics of AD patients’ EEG were showed to oscillate between more stable states. Moreover, the pathways used for transitions between stable states in AD patients were found to be longer. Finally, we show that features derived from energy landscapes can potentially be used for predicting AD with high accuracy. The results reported in this work suggest that brains of AD patients adapt to the damage and death of neurons by finding novel albeit suboptimal pathways for transitioning between stable states.</p>
