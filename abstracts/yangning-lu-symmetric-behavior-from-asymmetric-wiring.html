        <h1>Symmetric behavior from asymmetric wiring</h1><h2>Yangning Lu</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Caenorhabditis elegans maintains symmetric dorsal/ventral bending waves for locomotion in all developmental stages, during which its motor circuit undergoes significant rewiring. In adult, cholinergic motor neurons innervate and stimulate body wall muscles, and GABAergic motor neurons contra-laterally inhibit both sides. In the first larval (L1) stage however, a partial electron microscopy reconstruction suggests that cholinergic motor neurons only innervate dorsal muscles, and GABAergic motor neurons only innervate ventral muscles. How does such an asymmetric circuit produce symmetric output? 

To answer this long-standing question, we undertook anatomical and functional analyses of the L1 larva motor circuit. We reconstructed the neural connectivity of a complete L1 larva by electron microscopy, from which we identified previously uncharacterized muscle innervating cells. 

To elucidate the roles of these cells, we developed a novel all-optical manipulation methodology that allows bidirectional and systemic probing of neural circuits. We then combined calcium imaging, cellular ablation, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and all-optical interrogation to pinpoint mechanisms for symmetric muscle output. However, we found that the candidate cells identified from electron microscopy fail to explain output symmetry. Instead, we revealed that it is the excitatory premotor interneurons that provide extrasynaptic cholinergic activation to ventral muscles. Additionally, we found that ventral-innervating motor neurons provide extrasynaptic GABAergic relaxation to dorsal muscles. Thus, extrasynaptic pathways intricately compensate asymmetric synaptic wiring, allowing gait symmetry of newborn larvae.

These findings addressed the question of whether and how a neural circuit is able to operate symmetrically without structural symmetry. Our study highlighted the role of extrasynaptic transmission in regulating behavior, and demonstrated the dual role of both inter- and motor neurons in neuronal circuitry. It is possible that such mechanism is also utilized by other species to maintain stable behavioral output at different developmental stages, and beyond.</p>
