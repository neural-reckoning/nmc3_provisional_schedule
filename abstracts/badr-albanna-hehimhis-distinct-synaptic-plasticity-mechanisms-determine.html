A fraction of recorded cells typically exhibit trial-averaged responses with obvious task-related features and can be considered ‘classically-responsive’, such as pure tone frequency tuning in the auditory cortex. However, a substantial number of cells (including cells in primary sensory cortex) do not appear to fire in a task-related manner and are often neglected from analysis (Olshausen & Field 2006). Even classically-responsive cells lose their stimulus representation during task-engagement without impairing behavioral performance (Otazu et al., 2009). These results suggest that non-classically responsive cells may play an underappreciated role in sensory processing and cognition. Recently, we showed that non-classically responsive cells recorded from auditory cortex and frontal cortex contained hidden task-relevant information while animals performed a frequency recognition task at levels comparable to responsive cells using a novel single-trial spike-timing-based analysis (Insanally et al., 2019). However, the synaptic origins and potential contribution of these cells to network function remain unknown. To address this, we developed a novel class of spiking recurrent neural network models that incorporate both spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP; Bi and Poo, 1998; Vogels et al., 2011; D’amour and Froemke, 2015) and FORCE learning (Sussillo and Abbott, 2009; Nicola and Clopath, 2017) to perform an auditory-guided task. We find that (1) this model recapitulates the surprising number of non-classically responsive cells seen in vivo and (2) distinct STDP mechanisms alter single-unit response profiles with heterosynaptic plasticity playing a key role. Finally, our model also makes strong predictions about the synaptic origins of classically and non-classically responsive neurons which we can compare to in vivo whole-cell recordings taken from the auditory cortex of behaving animals.</p>
