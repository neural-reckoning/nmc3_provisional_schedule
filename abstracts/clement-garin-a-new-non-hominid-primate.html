In humans, one of the typical functional features of this network includes a strong correlated activity between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Although these connections are generally assumed to be present in other primates, recent studies highlight poor connection between these two regions in marmosets but strong correlations between PCC and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 8Ad). This disparity of the DMN connectivity has not yet been studied in other primates and no comparison was directly made with human data. Here, we aim to determine whether the humans DMN carries a connectivity pattern that distinguishes it from other primates. Moreover, we aim to identify the non-hominid primate network in which the mPFC is involved at rest. 
In the current study, we compared the resting-state network functional organisation in humans, macaques, and mouse lemurs. We discovered a network involving mPFC that was highly similar in both non-hominid primates but was not identified in humans. We also detected a non-hominid primate “DMN-like” dissimilar to that of humans that did not involve mPFC but dlPFC regions such as 8Ad. We created a functional atlas for each species and compared the fingerprint pattern and connectivity magnitude between various clusters of interest. We found strong correlation between PCC and mPFC in humans but not in mouse lemurs and macaques. These findings diverge from the current literature that propose strong similarities between primates and human’s DMN. Altogether, our results suggest that high order networks in non-hominid primates display closer characteristics between themselves than to humans. These findings suggest that important events may have occurred during the hominid evolution. We propose that a reorganization/fusion of the fronto-temporal/parietal network is an element of the singularity of the human DMN.</p>
