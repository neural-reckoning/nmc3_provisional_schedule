        <h1>LFP Phase Synchronization is Predictive of Performance in a Working Memory Task</h1><h2>Balbir Singh</h2><h3>Dr. Mitchell Riley, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Department of Psychology, Vanderbilt University; Dr. Xue-Lian Qi, Wake Forest School of Medicine;Dr. Christos Constantinidis,Wake Forest School of Medicine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neuronal activity in the primate lateral prefrontal cortex is innately specialized for the representation of visual-spatial information. However, the underlying dynamic changes in neuronal activity during the flexible execution of working memory tasks are still largely unknown. Here, we assess the neural oscillatory rhythms of high-density local field potentials (LFP) recorded using a 64 chronic electrode array implanted in the lateral prefrontal cortex from 225 sessions from two monkey.  Oscillatory dynamics such as distinct and bandlimited phase synchronization at the millisecond range is a ubiquitous signature of neuronal processing for basic and high-order control function. We used weighted-phase lag index (w-PLI) as index of the LFP synchronization. We found that phase synchronization of LFP at the beta frequency (20-35 Hz) oscillations was enhanced during training to perform a working memory task. Neuronal oscillations were more synchronized in the beta frequency range during correct than incorrect trials. Neuronal oscillations in error trials desynchronized especially during the stimulus presentation periods, as compared to baseline period in beta frequency.  The preferred phase is initiated the synchronization or desynchronization of the neural oscillatory dynamics for cognitive control. These findings demonstrate that plastic formation induces in working memory by responsive neural activity. Importantly, these finding suggest the notion that preferred phase in specific frequency strengthen the synchronization among proximal and distal local field potentials.</p>
