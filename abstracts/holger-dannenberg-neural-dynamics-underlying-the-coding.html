        <h1>Neural dynamics underlying the coding of location and running speed in the medial entorhinal cortex</h1><h2>Holger Dannenberg</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Memory-guided navigation and path integration require accurate coding of location and running speed. In mammals, path integration relies on memory circuits in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), where grid cells are proposed to provide a metric for space. The linear and positive modulation of firing rates observed in MEC speed cells has been proposed to provide a running speed signal for updating grid cell firing and supporting path integration.<br/>In the first part of my talk, I will demonstrate that rate coding of running speed by speed cells in the MEC differs across time scales and works best at seconds-long time scales. I will further present data that such a slow and linear rate code is insufficient for accurate real-time coding of running speed as required by current computational models of grid cell firing and path integration.<br/>Spatially periodic grid cell firing in the MEC relies on inputs from the medial septum. The second part of my talk will examine the role of medial septum inputs for theta oscillatory activity and speed cell firing in the MEC. <br/>The last part of my talk will examine the time course of changes in spatiotemporal accuracy of grid cell firing after transitions between light and dark conditions. Data will show that slow changes in grid cell stability on a time scale of tens of seconds are accompanied by slow changes in the local field potential theta frequency vs. running speed relationship, a proposed oscillatory speed signal. Furthermore, darkness results in large changes in the firing rates of many neurons including speed cells that explain the observed changes in the slopes of speed tuning curves. In summary, data suggest that the representation of space by grid cells in the MEC may be a function of velocity signals integrated over past time.</p>
