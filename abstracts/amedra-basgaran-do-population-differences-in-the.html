        <h1>Do population differences in the human gut microbiome predict the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease?</h1><h2>Amedra Basgaran</h2><h3>Amedra Basgaran, University College London; Eva Lymberopoulos, University College London; Maryam Reis-Dehabadi, University College London; Nikhil Sharma, University College London</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The human microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of microbes, thought to have symbiotic benefit to its host. Given the scale and complexity of the microbiome, it is not surprising that the current literature increasingly suggests a substantial contribution to disease.<br/><br/>Previous studies have identified influences of the microbiome on brain microglia as a mechanism contributing to neurodegeneration in conditions such as motor neurone disease and Parkinson’s disease. However, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), regarded as the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, remains a condition to be further investigated from the microbiome perspective. We further investigate this link by proposing correlations between population level differences in the gut microbiome and the prevalence of AD and other dementias within these regions.<br/><br/>Analyses were performed in R using microbiome and SIAMCAT packages using two large, open-access microbiome data sets (n=1006 & n >2000) (Lahti et al., 2014; Pasolli et al., 2017). Countries in these datasets were grouped based on AD prevalence and the microbiome profiles compared.<br/><br/>In regions and countries with a high prevalence of AD, there is a significantly lower diversity of the gut microbiome (p<0.0001). A PERMANOVA (p<0.05) revealed significant differences between several taxa in countries with high vs low prevalence of AD. Additionally, using machine learning, we were able to predict the prevalence of AD within a region or country based on the microbiome profile (Mean AUC 0.935 & 0.828). <br/> <br/>We conclude that differences in the microbiome between countries predict the varying prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias in these countries. Our results support a key role of the microbiome in neurodegeneration, potentially via its effects on microglia.We propose further steps to include experimental models to directly investigate causation between the taxa identified and the risk of developing dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. </p>
