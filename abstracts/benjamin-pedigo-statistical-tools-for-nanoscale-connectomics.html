Priebe, Johns Hopkins University; Joshua T. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Connectomics (the study of neural wiring) is a relatively new discipline in neuroscience. Complete circuit mapping at the synaptic scale (nanoscale) has the potential to inform wide ranging questions in neuroscience, such as understanding how circuit architecture leads to activity, or how genetics or disease affect neural architecture. Recent technological advances are enabling connectomics datasets to scale into the tens or hundreds of thousands of neurons and millions of synapses. Increasingly, learning from and comparing such large connectome datasets will require techniques for statistical learning on network data. Here we describe several examples of such statistical techniques on the Drosophila larva connectome. For example, we present methodology for clustering and model fitting on the connectome, and show that statistical models of networks can be used to inform the clustering process. We show that the connectivity-based clustering is sensible in terms of known cell types, but also suggests new groupings of neurons for investigation. Then, we briefly touch on other statistical techniques and how they can be applied to connectomes. These methods will enable automated analyses of connectomes at scale (such as classifying cells into types based on their connectivity), but also serve as a basis for future work on comparing connectomes across individual, taxa, or disease state, for example. We provide implementations of all of these methods via an open-source Python package, graspologic. For discussion in this interactive session, we also ask the community what analysis techniques will be the most important to develop as the field moves forward.</p>
