        <h1>EEG Delta Rhythms in Visual Association Cortices Mark Syntactic Constituents</h1><h2>M. Blake Rafferty</h2><h3>Devin M. Casenhiser</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent work has suggested that syntactic processes may be indexed neurologically via amplitude changes in EEG delta oscillations (1-4Hz). However, these observations have been primarily limited to the frequency domain, and little is known of how delta oscillations are modulated in real-time while syntactic processes are performed. In the present study, we used time-frequency analysis to characterize delta responses at constituent boundaries in sentences with a fixed grammatical pattern in contrast to lexically-matched scrambled lists with no obvious syntactic structure. We also sought to identify whether delta activity is modulated by lexico-semantic content. To do this, we included two additional sentence types: Jabberwocky sentences with identical morpho-syntax to grammatical sentence stimuli but where all content words were replaced by nonsense words and a scrambled version of these sentences. Analyses were conducted on the basis of structure (English + Nonsense sentences with grammar vs. English + Nonsense sentences scrambled) and lexico-semantic content (English with Grammar + English scrambled vs. Nonsense with Grammar + Nonsense scrambled). Results of time-frequency analysis revealed no effect of lexico-semantic content; however, higher delta power was observed at constituent boundaries for sentences with grammatical structure relative to word-lists. Post-hoc source analyses identified left-fusiform gyrus as the primary generator of this difference. The fusiform gyrus has been suggested as an interface between the sensory and conceptual systems in order to facilitate efficient visual processing, and as such, it is frequently activated during reading tasks like the one used in the present study. Considering this, we argue that delta oscillations emanating from the fusiform gyrus may reflect the integration of visual information with top-down knowledge of syntactic structure.</p>
