However, whether the memory advantage of emotional faces persists over years and which neural systems may mediate such an effect remains unknown. The present study investigated recognition of incidentally encoded faces with angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral expressions over a retention interval of >1.5 years (N = 102). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that, following the long retention interval, faces with threatening expressions (i.e. angry and fearful) were significantly better recognized than happy and neutral faces. Comparison with immediate recognition performance indicated that this effect was driven by decreased recognition of non-threatening faces over the retention interval. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired during encoding and results revealed that differential neural reactivity to faces with different expressions in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex/medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) neurally mediated the long-term recognition advantage for threatening faces. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence that threatening facial expressions during initial encounters lead to persistent face recognition over periods of at least 1.5 years, and that encoding-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex may underlie the preserved recognition. The findings have implications for understanding emotional memory formation in interpersonal contexts and have implications for affective disorders characterized by dysregulations in interpersonal and emotional memory domains.
