        <h1>Functional brain network for perisaccadic visual processing: evidence from high resolution EEG and graph theory analysis</h1><h2>Amirhossein Ghaderi</h2><h3>Amirhossein Ghaderi, Centre for Vision Research, York University, and Vision Science to Applications (VISTA) Program, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada;  Matthias Niemeier, 3Department of Psychology, University of Toronto Scarborough, Toronto, ON, Canada; John Douglas Crawford, Centre for Vision Research, York University, and Vision Science to Applications (VISTA) Program, York University, Toronto, ON, Canada</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The cortical network involved in the perisaccadic visual processing is still poorly understood and debates remain to find how brain can integrate the information from two visual fields (i.e. pre- and post- saccadic fixation points). Here, we constructed functional brain networks from Electroencephalography (EEG) data in the perisaccadic interval. Then, we evaluated the topological and spectral properties of the perisaccadic network. EEG was recorded via 64 channels in two behavioral conditions (fixation and saccade). Participants (N=21) were pre-cued with a series 1-3 grids (three horizontal lines, 10째 by 10째) located 5째 below the central fixation-point. In the saccade condition, saccades (recorded by Electrooculography) were cued by a sudden shift of the fixation-point to 10째 left/right. 100ms later, a stimulus (three vertical lines; same size/location) was briefly presented (for 70ms). Saccades were occurred after the stimulus presentation. Fixation condition was identical, except the fixation-point remained in the centre. LORETA source localization was performed on the 200ms period following the saccade cue, or the equivalent time during fixation trials. Lagged coherences were calculated between all pairs of 84 Brodmann areas. Graph theory analysis (GTA) was implemented to find clustering coefficient (C), global efficiency (E), energy (H), entropy (S). Nonparametric permutation test showed higher values for C, E, H, and S in all frequency bands for the saccade task (relative to the fixation task). These results suggest that the segregation, integration, synchronizability, and complexity of brain network were simultaneously enhanced during the perisaccadic interval (in comparison to the fixation). The increased network properties can suggest a mechanism for high-level information processing (that is related to increased entropy in the network) and high-speed information propagation (that is associated with higher energy, clustering coefficient, and efficiency in the network) during the perisaccadic interval.   </p>
