        <h1>A Quantification of Dendritic and dendritic spine morphology in Cyclooxygenase - 2 – Knockin Mice  </h1><h2>Ashby Kissoondoyal</h2><h3>Ravneet Rai-Bhogal; Crawford Dorota, York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: ProstaglandinE2 (PGE2) is a lipid signaling molecule involved in normal neurodevelopment. Abnormal PGE2 signalling due to genetic or environmental causes has been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previously our lab demonstrated that disrupting the function of COX2, the rate-limiting enzyme of PGE2 production affects the expression of developmental genes important in synaptic transmission and dendritic spine formation in males. Further, Ptgs2 Y385F knockin (COX2-KI) animals demonstrate autism-like behaviours, including impairments in social interaction and motor strength, and repetitive and anxious behaviors. Our Objective was to examine the effect of abnormal PGE2 signalling on the morphology of cerebellar dendritic spines. 
Methods: We examined GOLGI-COX stained cerebellums of COX2-KI and Wild-type B6.129S6(FVB)-Ptgs2tm1.1Fun/J (WT) mice at postnatal day 25 (PN25). We measured dendrite length, branching, and thickness, the proportion of dendrites forming axonal loops, and dendritic spine density and morphology. Measurements were compared between and within conditions (COX2-KI and WT) and sex. 
Results: COX2-KI mice had greater dendritic arborization within 40µm of the soma than WT mice.  Dendrite thickness was greater in WT Females than WT Males. In contrast COX2-KI Males had thicker dendrites than COX2-KI Females. Compared to WT mice, the odds of observing axonal loops was higher in COX2-KI mice. While dendritic spine density was greater in WT Males compared to WT Females, there was no significant difference between COX2-KI Males and Females. Examining dendritic spine morphology, WT Males were less likely to have immature (stubby and filopodia) spine shapes compared to mature (mushroom) shapes, whereas WT females were more likely to have immature (stubby and thin) shapes. Showing the opposite trend, COX2-KI Males and Females were more likely to have immature (stubby and thin) shapes, and mature (mushroom) shapes respectively.  These findings show that PGE2 signalling disruptions in the COX2-KI result in sex-dependent abnormalities in cerebellar neuronal development.
