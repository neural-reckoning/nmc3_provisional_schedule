        <h1>Cell-type specific nonlinearities in frontal-sensory integration in the parietal cortex</h1><h2>Gyorgy Lur</h2><h3>Daniel Y. Rindner, UC Irvine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Top-down influences, including memory and attention, strongly affect sensory processing. Yet, synaptic interaction of cognitive and sensory information streams remains largely undescribed. Non-linear interactions have been frequently observed during multisensory processing, however, technical challenges so far prohibited the mechanistic exploration of how top-down and bottom-up afferents interact. Here, we employ a dual-color optogenetic strategy to determine the spatiotemporal features of multi-modal synaptic integration in the mouse posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We expressed a red light sensitive channelrhodopsin variant in the primary auditory cortex (A1) and a blue light sensitive opsin in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a frontal region commonly associated with attention and working memory. This opsin combination allowed independent control of sensory and frontal inputs to the PPC. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings in acute brain slices we show that the PPC receives direct, monosynaptic inputs from both A1 and ACC. Similarly to other cortical areas, layer 5 principal cells in the PPC show heterogeneity in their firing patterns. We found that two classes of pyramidal neurons, intrinsically bursting and regular spiking, have distinct patterns of frontal-sensory integration. Intrinsically bursting cells displayed a supralinear enhancement of coincident input from ACC and A1, an effect that diminished with increasing delays between inputs. Conversely, regular spiking cells showed maximal enhancement when afferents were activated with delay, and robust suppression of coincident inputs. Intriguingly, we also found that co-activating frontal and sensory inputs significantly enhanced sustained activity in the PPC microcircuit, indicating a potential role in working memory processes. Our data suggest that frontal-sensory integration has cell-type specificity in the PPC, and begins to unravel the circuit architecture of multi-modal integration.<br/></p>
