During this period increased glucocorticoid exposure of the embryo has been associated with adverse neurobehavioral, e.g. increased attention deficits, and physiological outcomes, e.g. brain structural and functional changes, later in life. Glucocorticoids are one of the main factors mediating stress effects prenatally and one of the main systems found dysregulated in stress-related psychiatric disorders. To investigate these processes in a human specific and reactive system, we used induced Pluripotent Stem Cells-derived 3-dimensional cerebral organoids to model prenatally mediated risk and response to stress and combined them with in vivo mouse models of neurodevelopment. We found a very promising candidate gene for neurodevelopmentally-relevant glucocorticoids response in ZBTB16, which had previously been shown to respond to glucocorticoids in human blood samples.  ZBTB16 is a transcription factor expressed during early development associated with maintenance of the neuronal progenitor pool. ZBTB16 is expressed dynamically throughout human neurodevelopment with high expression in the progenitor cells (PAX6+ cells) early on and downregulation when the first neuronal markers (MAP2, DCX) appear. Chronic dexamethasone exposure (100nM) of organoids for 7 days results in a robust increase of ZBTB16 expression in the progenitor cells. We used in utero electroporations in mice at different developmental time-points and ex vivo electroporations in human cerebral organoids to overexpress ZBTB16, mimicking the effect of glucocorticoids on the transcription factor. Overexpression of ZBTBT16 leads to increased time of proliferation of progenitor cells (PH3+cells) and increased neurogenic divisions of the intermediate progenitor cells (TBR2+ cells). We are working on the molecular signalling pathway of glucocorticoids through ZBTB16 using a ChIP-seq experiment for ZBTB16 in cerebral organoids. We identified ZBTB16 as a mediator of altered neuronal differentiation processes after glucocorticoids stimulation. The molecular mechanisms and pathways we shed light on in this work could have profound implications for our understanding risk to stress exposure during early brain development, and consequently psychopathology vulnerability.</p>
