        <h1>Challenges and opportunities for neuroscience societies in virtual space</h1><h2>Jasper Hunt (he/him)</h2><h3>Tara Diviney, University of Oxford; Marta Blanco-Pozo, University of Oxford; Raffaele Sarnataro, University of Oxford</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>While many events within the neuroscience community have been delayed or cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, others have moved from a physical setting to a virtual one. The Oxford University Cortex Club is a students/postdocs society operating at the intersections of science communication, policy discussion, and scientific advocacy. Here, we recount the benefits and challenges our society has faced in moving our programming to wholly digital media. Could virtual formats paradoxically both increase and limit access to events? In this talk, we will distill some of the major questions surrounding access, equity and openness that will remain when physical events become feasible once more.</p>
