        <h1>Exploring the relationship between functional ultrasound and neuronal activity </h1><h2>Anwar Nunez-Elizalde</h2><h3>Michael Krumin, UCL; Charu B Reddy, UCL; Gabriel Montaldo, KU Leuven and NERF; Alan Urban,  KU Leuven and NERF; Kenneth D Harris, UCL; Matteo Carandini, UCL</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) is an appealing method for measuring blood-volume signals from the brain. However, the blood-volume signal measured by fUSi bears an unclear relationship to the underlying neuronal firing. Is this relationship linear, and stable across brain regions, subjects, and time?

To answer these questions, we performed simultaneous fUSi measurements and Neuropixels recordings in awake mice. Eight recording sessions were performed across four mice (~4 coronal slices per session). We inserted one or two Neuropixels probes per session, and related firing recorded from these probes to fUSi signals from the corresponding regions of interest (ROIs).

A linear model provided a good estimate of fUSi signals based on neuronal firing. We measured the multi-unit activity (MUA) from the Neuropixel probes and convolved it with a hemodynamic filter (4.2 s causal window). The filter was estimated using a linear regression model using half the data from one recording, and tested on the second half. Model predictions were accurate (r > 0.5). Furthermore, this model generalized across mice: it increased prediction accuracy relative to an instantaneous MUA model with no delay in all sessions in all three held-out mice. The hemodynamic filter resembled one measured optically, peaking ~1.5 s after neural activity (Pisauro, et al., J Neurosci 2013).

These results indicate that the relationship between neuronal firing and fUSi is stable and linear. Our current efforts aim to optimize the processing of fUSi signals so that they best capture variations in neuronal firing across both time and space.
