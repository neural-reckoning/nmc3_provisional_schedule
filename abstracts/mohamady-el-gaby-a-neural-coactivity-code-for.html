        <h1>A Neural Coactivity Code for Dynamic Memory</h1><h2>Mohamady El-Gaby</h2><h3>Hayley M Reeve; Vítor Lopes-dos-Santos; Natalia Campo-Urriza; Pavel V Perestenko; Alexander Morley; Lauren Strickland; István P Lukács; Ole Paulsen; David Dupret</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Information is encoded in the combined activity of multiple neurons. Notably, millisecond-timescale coactivity provides fundamental building blocks for some neural codes. Such short-timescale coactivity binds neurons with related tuning to external variables, giving rise to population-based representations congruent with those of their participating neurons. Alternatively, groups of neurons that are not individually tuned to a given variable may nevertheless encode such a variable as a function of their coactivity. While this type of emergent coding has been described for physically well-defined variables such as specific sensory inputs and actions, its possible cognitive function has not been explored. Here we show that coactivity-based representations provide a neural code for dynamic memories, where animals rapidly learn and flexibly retrieve short-lived behavioural contingencies every day. We trained mice to discriminate two new behavioural contingencies each day, while monitoring and manipulating neural ensembles in the hippocampal CA1. We found that short-timescale coactivity contained robust contingency information. Unlike coactivity patterns encoding space, which comprised neurons with overlapping place fields, coactivity-based contingency discrimination was unrelated to the tuning of individual neurons but instead an emergent property of their combined activity. Such millisecond, but not longer, timescale coactivity was flexibly reinstated to predict trial-by-trial memory performance. Moreover, optogenetic suppression of synaptic inputs from the upstream CA3 region selectively during learning impaired coactivity-based contingency information in CA1 and subsequent dynamic memory retrieval. These findings show that short-timescale coactivity stitches together individually untuned neurons to represent abstract, task-relevant variables in support of dynamic memory retrieval. Millisecond coactivity-based representations may preferentially exhibit the rapid dynamics needed to mnemonically process short-lived cognitive variables.</p>
