Ltd., Jiangsu, China   </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Changes in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) following neural injury or as part of a neurodegenerative process lead to the inhibition of myelin repair. In Multiple sclerosis, CSPGs are deposited at the border of active and expanding demyelinating lesions and may create a barrier for regeneration and contribute to neurodegeneration. CSPG inhibition of axonal regeneration is partially mediated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPσ) receptor. PTPσ is also the main player of CSPG inhibition of oligodendrocyte (OL) outgrowth and myelination. Intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) binds to PTPσ and relieves CSPG-mediated inhibition and has been used to promote regeneration after spinal cord injury. Identification of PTPσ as a functional receptor for CSPGs presents a promising avenue of investigation to rescue OL activity and promote recovery in demyelinating lesions.<br/><br/>Here we show that ISP treatment can improve functional recovery in animal models of multiple sclerosis and highlight cellular changes involved in the process. The EAE mice treated with ISP significantly recovered hindlimb function, and showed considerably reduced neuroinflammation and immune infiltration, smaller demyelinating lesion sites, and significantly more neurofilament sparing. After systemic demyelination, mice that received ISP showed motor and cognitive improvements that correlated with increased remyelination and decreased neuroinflammation.  We further demonstrate that delaying ISP administration by two weeks in a chronic disease model leads to a lesser degree of functional and histological improvements while still significantly improving the condition, highlighting the importance of modulating CSPG signalling at an incipient stage of the disease. In vitro, astrocytes, microglia and OPCs exposed to CSPGs showed inhibitory responses that were ameliorated by ISP addition .  Overall, our results suggest an exciting avenue for regeneration by targeting RPTPσ, supporting further consideration for therapeutic usage.<br/><br/></p>
