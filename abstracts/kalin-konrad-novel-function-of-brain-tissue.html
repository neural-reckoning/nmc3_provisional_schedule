        <h1>Novel Function of Brain Tissue-Specific MicroRNA-124 in Regulating Mesodermal Cell Fate </h1><h2>Kalin Konrad</h2><h3>Santiago Suarez, University of Delaware; Jia L. Song, University of Delaware </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) has a highly conserved role in regulating the intricate balance between proliferation and differentiation during neurogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the novel role this neuron-specific microRNA (miR-124) in regulating mesodermal cell specification as well as its conserved function during neurogenesis. Our lab uses the sea urchin as a model due to its high fecundity, well-documented gene regulatory networks (GRN), and the fact that it contains a single miR-124, making it a simplified model to incorporate miR-124â€™s function into the GRN. MiR-124 has been observed in an array of species to directly suppress Notch to promote the neuronal linage. In sea urchin, Notch signaling is important for neurogenesis later in development while its earlier function is to modulate the specification of the mesoderm. We bioinformatically identified one or more potential miR-124 binding sites of Notch, Nodal, Ese (blastocoelar specific transcription factor), and Gcm (pigment cell specific transcription factor). The sea urchin Delta/Notch signaling pathway initiates specification of mesodermally-derived blastocoelar and pigment cells and later Nodal signaling ensures proper segregation of these cells to perform immune functions. We have determined that miR-124 directly suppresses Nodal, Notch, and blastcoelar specific transcription factor Ese to mediate proper specification and development of these immune cells. More recently we aim to reveal the molecular mechanism by which miR-124 impacts neurogenesis. We have observed that when we inhibit miR-124 that there is a significant decrease in mature neurons as well as an overall decrease in levels of serotonin expressing neurons. This decrease in specified neurons in miR-124 knockdown embryos as also resulted in slower-moving larval behavior. Due to our results and literature I predict that miR-124 directly inhibits Notch to mediate neurogenesis. I propose to test this by using a modified oligo designed to flank the binding site of miR-124 identified within Notch. By removing miR-124 suppression of Notch I will be able to determine if this proposed mechanism explains the overall decreased specified neurons in my miR-124 knockdown embryos. Our results have revealed a vital role of miR-124 in mesodermal cell specification, in addition to testing its conserved function in promoting neural differentiation in sea urchin.</p>
