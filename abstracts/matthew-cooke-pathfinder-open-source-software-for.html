Spatial navigational tasks are routinely used to study learning, memory and goal-directed behavior, in both animals and humans. One popular paradigm for testing spatial memory is the Morris water maze. Researchers typically express learning as a function of the latency to escape, though this reveals little about the underlying navigational strategies. Recently, a number of studies have begun to classify water maze search strategies in order to clarify the precise spatial and mnemonic functions of different brain regions. However, despite their usefulness, strategy analyses have not been widely adopted due to the lack of software to automate analyses. We developed Pathfinder, an open source application for analyzing spatial navigation behaviour. Here we show Pathfinderâ€™s performance on a sample dataset, where it effectively characterized highly-specific spatial search strategies used during the trials. Our software provides support for inputs from commonly-used, commercially-available and open-source software packages, is optimized for classifying search strategies, and can also be expanded easily to work with other species and spatial navigation tasks. Pathfinder has the ability to automatically determine the platform location as well as the size of the pool and related pool parameters.  It can generate heatmaps of trials, analyze navigation with respect to multiple goal locations, and can be easily updated to accommodate future developments in spatial navigation behaviours.</p>
