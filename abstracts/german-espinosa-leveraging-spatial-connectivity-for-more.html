        <h1>Leveraging spatial connectivity for more efficient planning in naturalistic scenarios</h1><h2>German Espinosa</h2><h3>German Espinosa, Malcolm A. MacIver</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The brute-force approach to planning, where the number of possible futures grows exponentially with the number of possible moves per step, fails to be tractable when the number of steps is large. There are methods to subsample the tree of possibilities to make the calculation tractable in such cases. These include Monte-Carlo tree search and variants like UCB1. In this talk, we present the results of a different strategy motivated by recent work in our group that indicates where plan-based action selection is most useful. Consider a discretized space being planned over, with some cells containing barriers/occlusions/gateways, and other cells being open. Rather than each possible position in a space being considered during planning, the agent plans over locations in the space where there is a transition in the graph connectivity. In the real world these transitions include barriers, corridors, gateways, and bottlenecks where the prey can hide. These locations are where the largest potential reward value changes happen. To bridge between these locations during plan execution, shortest path trajectories are calculated. This method enables planning a number of steps ahead that is several orders of magnitude larger than planning where every location of the space is considered. We present results in an idealized predator-prey scenario where we show that this method provides similar survival rates for the prey as UCB1 but with far fewer compute steps. In future work we will be deploying this method for guiding mobile robots that are interacting with animals in real time.</p>
