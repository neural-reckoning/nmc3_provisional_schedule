        <h1>Synaptic evidence for the cumulative effects of tDCS in spaced learning  </h1><h2>Mahima Sharma</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is thought to improve learning by modulating Hebbian synaptic plasticity. The majority of in vitro studies supporting this theory use electric fields that are much higher than those generated with transcranial stimulation in humans (20V/m vs 1 V/m). The effectiveness of tDCS has also been called into question because of the relatively small effect sizes. There is therefore a need to improve the effectiveness of tDCS at realistic field intensities. Here we leverage the observation that effects of learning in humans are known to accumulate over multiple bouts of learning, known as spaced learning. This cumulative effect has been replicated in synaptic long term potentiation (LTP) experiments in vitro.    Hypothesis: We propose that effects of DCS on synaptic LTP can accumulate over time in a spaced learning paradigm.    Methods: We studied the cumulative effects of DCS at various intensities applied during the induction of LTP in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices using theta burst stimulation (TBS).  Results: DCS applied during repeated bouts of TBS resulted in an increase of LTP.  Spaced learning saturated quickly with strong TBS protocols, thus obscuring cumulative effects of DCS. However, with weaker TBS, we saw a cumulative effect of spaced learning, including a cumulative boost of LTP with electric fields of lower intensity.    Conclusions: These results support the notion that the effects of tDCS accumulate through an increasing synaptic strength after repeated bouts of learning. </p>
