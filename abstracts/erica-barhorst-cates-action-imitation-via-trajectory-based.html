        <h1>Action imitation via trajectory-based or posture-based planning</h1><h2>Erica Barhorst-Cates</h2><h3>Mitchell W Isaacs, Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute; Laurel J Buxbaum, Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute; Aaron L Wong, Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Movement imitation is a significant daily activity involved in social interaction and motor learning. Although imitation remains poorly understood, recent research suggests that it may be achieved in two distinct ways. In posture-based imitation, movements reproduce how the body should look and feel, and are sensitive to the relative positioning of body parts. In trajectory imitation, movements mimic the spatiotemporal motion path of the end effector. We hypothesized that people can imitate via either mechanism. If true, we would expect to see a switch cost when individuals change from one mechanism to the other. To test this, twenty-five healthy young adults performed a sequential multitasking imitation task. Participants were first instructed to pay attention to the limb postures or the hand path of a video-recorded model. They next performed an intervening motor task that was neutral, congruent, or incongruent with the instructed imitation type. Finally, participants imitated the modeled movement. Spatiotemporal imitation accuracy was greatest after a neutral intervening task, and worst after posture matching. When the primary task involved imitating trajectories, we observed a switch cost: movements following the posture-matching intervening task were less consistent with baseline (neutral) performance, suggesting performance was disrupted by the incongruence. Incongruent primary and intervening tasks also reduced cross-subject consistency. Such effects were not observed when imitating limb postures. In summary, we observed a partial dissociation between posture matching and trajectory imitation as a result of instructions and intervening tasks that is nevertheless consistent with the existence of two computationally distinct imitation mechanisms. </p>
