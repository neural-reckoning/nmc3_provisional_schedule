        <h1>Accuracy, Confidence and Decision-time of Perceptual Decisions in Discrete vs Continuous Environment</h1><h2>Zahra Azizi</h2><h3>Zahra Azizi, Institute for Cognitive Science Studies, Tehran, Iran; Reza Ebrahimpour, Cognitive Science Research lab., Department of Computer Engineering, Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University, Tehran, Iran; Sajjad Zabbah, School of Cognitive Sciences, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In many cases, decisions require information integration from pieces of evidence with discrete time intervals. Yet, the neural mechanism underlying these decisions is uncertain.
This research has mainly concentrated on accuracy, confidence, and decision-time of double-pulse vs single-pulse stimulus. To inspect the concept, behavioral and electroencephalography (EEG) data have been analyzed.
Accordingly, we applied a perceptual decision-making experiment using Random Dot Motions (RDM) paradigm. Participants had to indicate the predominant direction of motion of a cloud of moving dots (left or right) by saccadic eye movement to the chosen target after receiving one or two pulses of 120 ms of information. Both direction and strength of the motion changed trial by trial. Moreover, the interval of two pulses is selected randomly from 0, 120, 360, and 1080 ms. Healthy adult subjects were tested and meanwhile, we used a 32-channel amplifier for the EEG signal recording. Here, we searched for the relation of accuracy, confidence, decision-time, and their ERP (Event-related potential) characterizations in a more real-life like decision-making.
Results from behavioral and the ERP have shown that participants develop similar behavior but with some differences in the discrete vs continuous environment. Subjectsâ€™ performance and confidence were independent of the intervals up 1 s. However, unlike the confidence, accuracy improved considerably in double-pulse trials. Moreover, when participants had better accuracy, their decision-time (the time between response cue and saccadic response) decreased. Interestingly, the decision-time of single-pulse trials was significantly longer compared to double-pulse trials. The grand-average ERP results showed a peak observed around 300 ms after the stimulus offset. This peak was identified to be related to decision-making and significantly increased in faster decisions.
To summarize, it seems, along with the continuous environment, accuracy, confidence, and decision-time could be tracked from ERPs component during decision-making in a discrete environment.
