        <h1>Computer-aided design (CAD) helps build and share design of experimental setups</h1><h2>Andrey Andreev</h2><h3>David Prober, California Institute of Technology</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Computer-aided design (CAD) became much more accessible and user-friendly. It can be used to virtually assemble experimental setups, such as microscopes, from parts, design and integrate custom parts that can be ordered for fabrication or in-house 3D printing. Designs can be shared almost without limitation. Here we will show some of the features of Autodesk Fusion360 that helped us to design light-sheet microscope for zebrafish whole-brain activity imaging during Covid19 pandemic-related shutdown, and assemble it in less than 3 months, when we were allowed to resume occasional on-campus work. Using CAD software allows rapid design, as well as seamless distribution of designs with publication. Starting with computer-generated designs provides painless generation of figures, schematics, renderings, and animations that will attract attention of your audience and explain your work better. Assembling setup from parts (such as from Thorlabs or Newport) automatically provides list of parts, which is useful for publications and accounting. A lot of commercial software products have free licenses, especially for academics, which should make CAD a standard of practice. There are a lot of nuance when it comes to CAD and 3D design (incompatible formats, licensing, lack of openness, and other issues) but even baseline, naïve (such as author’s) application of CAD will greatly increase value of work.</p>
