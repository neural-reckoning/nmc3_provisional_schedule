        <h1>Braisian Networks: A Bayesian-like Connectionist Model Displaying Flexible Learning and Network Wide Bursting.</h1><h2>Tsvi Achler</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Rigorous models of brain recognition (of how information is obtained, evaluated & stored) are essential to assess understanding, guide experiments and research strategies especially since understanding recognition is necessary for understanding most other brain functions. The most brain-like models are Bayesian Networks because they display logic and control through priors and likelihoods, but are neither connectionist (implementable with neurons) nor scalable because distributions must be calculated.  Neural Networks are connectionist during recognition and scalable, but likelihoods and priors are not accessible and distributions are embedded into synaptic weights during learning through a complex rehearsal mechanism emulating shuffling casino card dealers. Unfortunately this rehearsal is difficult to model with neurons (thus not connectionist during learning) and the nuances of rehearsal for synaptic weight learning are commonly ignored in models, confounding understanding.  Moreover neither of the above models shows brain phenomena such as Network-Wide Bursting (NWB). If real brains at a resting state are presented with a new or unexpected stimulus, neurons show a fast increase in activation (NWB of many neurons) followed by a slower inhibition, until the network settles again to a resting state.  We introduce Braisian Networks with connectionist regulatory feedback connections that iterate during recognition and essentially estimate distributions.  They allow flexible brain-like learning of likelihoods without rehearsal or distributions thus are connectionist both during learning and recognition.  We demonstrate flexibility by learning common data sets in an order that is not suited for neural networks and the NWB phenomenon as a fundamental outcome of the network.  Our goal is for neuroscientists to adopt more rigorous brain-like connectionist models both during recognition and learning to accelerate the field forward.</p>
