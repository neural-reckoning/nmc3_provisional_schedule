        <h1>3D Human Cortical Organoids to investigate developmental epileptic encephalopathies</h1><h2>Monica Tambalo</h2><h3>Sara Mancinelli, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS; Rosalba Olga Proce, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS;Filippo Mirabella, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS; Davide Pozzi, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS; Michela Matteoli, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS; Simona Lodato, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center-IRCCS</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The human cerebral cortex is characterized by an extraordinary complexity of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types wired together for the execution of high-order cognitive functions. Alterations, during fetal development as well as after birth, in the assembly of cortical neuronal circuits can lead to aberrant neuronal activity and abnormal firing patterns, shared signs of neurodevelopmental disorders. Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathies (EIEE), a heterogeneous group of devastating childhood epilepsy disorders with a strong genetic component, constitute the most precocious syndromes that can affect infants as early as in the womb. EIEE mutations are associated with a variety of proteins implicated in a wide range of developmental processes, from neuronal migration and cell adhesion to transcriptional regulation and synaptic transmission (i.e. ARX, PCDH19, HCN1, FOXG1, SCN1A, GABAA). Despite the number of genes linked to EIEE is growing the etiology remains unknown for most cases, and it is challenging to decouple the patient-specific genetic make-up from the effect of the aberrant activity per se on brain development. To answer this fundamental question and address unique features of human development, we are exploiting a highly reproducible human cortical organoids (hCOs) system, on which we are inducing acute seizure-like currents, to model infantile/pediatric epilepsy in vitro. To address the implications of activity on circuit assembly, we aim to map at the single-cell level the epigenetic and transcriptional landscape of treated and untreated hCOs, with the final goal of deciphering the epigenetic fingerprints produced by exacerbate activity in distinct classes of cortical neurons. Identification the of aberrant pathways associated with epileptic seizures will constitute an invaluable resource to discover novel anti-epileptic drug targets for infantile/pediatric epilepsy.</p>
