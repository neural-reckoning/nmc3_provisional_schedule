Yates,  Brain and Cognitive Science, University of Rochester; Aaron J. Levi,  Center for Perceptual Systems, Departments of Neuroscience & Psychology,The University of Texas at Austin; Alexander C. Huk,  Center for Perceptual Systems, Departments of Neuroscience & Psychology, The University of Texas at Austin; Il Memming Park,  Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In sensorimotor decision-making, internal representation of sensory stimuli is utilized for the generation of appropriate behavior for the context. For stimuli near perceptual threshold, the trial-by-trial activity of single neurons in many sensory areas is correlated with the animal's perceptual report. This correlation between variability in sensory neurons and perceptual decisions has often been attributed to feedforward readout of the neural activity by the downstream decision-making circuits. However the interpretation is quite ambiguous and the correlation could also originate via feedback from decision-making mechanisms downstream of the sensory representation. Its meaning can be better understood in the light of population-wide correlations among sensory neurons. <br/>The middle temporal (MT) area contains both sensory and choice information and is known to be the key sensory area for visual motion perception. Using a statistical nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique on single-trial ensemble recordings during perceptual-decision-making, we extracted low-dimensional latent factors that captured the population-wide fluctuations and dissected the particular contributions of sensory-driven versus choice-correlated activity in the low-dimensional population code.<br/>We found that the latent factors strongly encoded the direction of the stimulus in a single dimension with a temporal signature similar to that of single MT neurons. If the downstream circuit were optimally utilizing this information, choice-correlated signals should be aligned with this stimulus encoding dimension. Thus the decision-making process may be corrupting the sensory representation. Surprisingly, we found that the sensory stimuli and choice variables are separate at the population level contradicting the optimal readout view. This misaligned choice information allows the feedforward sensory information to coexist with the decision-making process. The time course of these signals suggest that this misaligned contribution likely is feedback from the downstream areas.<br/>This new insight postulates how neural systems can maintain a mixed representation while allowing learning and adaptation.<br/></p>
