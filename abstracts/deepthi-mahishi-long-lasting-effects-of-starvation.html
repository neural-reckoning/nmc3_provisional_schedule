        <h1>Long-lasting effects of starvation experience on fly activity and place preference </h1><h2>Deepthi Mahishi</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Animal behavior and actions are demonstrably governed by sensory stimulation and internal states like hunger. Depending on starvation levels, priorities shift between diverse energy-expensive activities and foraging/feeding. Flies are known to execute efficient path integration strategies during foraging. However, the long-term activity pattern for both hungry and satiated flies in conditions of foraging remain to be better understood. Similarly, little is known about how chronic contact chemosensory stimulation affects locomotion. To address these questions, we have developed a novel, simplistic fly activity tracking setup â€“ the Panopticon. Our assay allows recording of walking behavior, of several flies in parallel, each surrounded by a uniform substrate layer. Individual animals are placed for >24 h in agarose-coated sectors of a 3D-printed Petri dish inset. We employ Fiji-based video tracking, followed by a custom-built MATLAB analysis framework, which allows multifaceted assessment of fly activity patterns, including representation of walking trails and location probability as a function of time. </p>
