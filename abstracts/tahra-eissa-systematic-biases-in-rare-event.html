        <h1>Systematic biases in rare-event inferences</h1><h2>Tahra Eissa</h2><h3>Josh Gold, University of Pennsylvania; Kresimir Josic, University of Houston; Zachary Kilpatrick, University of Colorado Boulder</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>When choosing between different options we often rely on information of non-uniform frequency and quality. For example, when evidence for one option is rare, these observations are of high quality, while evidence that may be abundant is often less convincing. Moreover, the information available to an observer is often limited, restricting the amount of high-quality evidence that may be obtained.  How do human observers make decisions in situations with asymmetric evidence quality, especially when the amount of evidence is limited? Recruiting over 200 subjects from crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk, we consider how humans approach these decisions with a task in which subjects observe a sequence of red/blue balls drawn with replacement from one of two jars with known ratios of ball colors. Subjects must infer which of the two equally probable jars the balls were drawn from. When both jars have ball ratios that favor the same color (one ball color is rare), subjects show a strong bias toward the jar with the more extreme ratio, even when evidence came from the higher-fraction jar. Notably, these biases are predicted by an ideal Bayesian observer.  However, many human observers show an enhanced bias in line with a Bayesian but not optimal approach. We have attributed this enhancement to subjects underweighing the information gained by a rare ball observation along with an overall preference for the more extreme response. We confirmed these results using model-free information theory metrics that showed a drop-off in the effective use of task information as subjects deviated from the ideal observer. Thus, our study yields new quantitative insights into rare-event inference, which is relevant to both real-world problems (like predicting stock-market crashes) and common laboratory tasks (like inferring rare state changes in dynamic environments).</p>
