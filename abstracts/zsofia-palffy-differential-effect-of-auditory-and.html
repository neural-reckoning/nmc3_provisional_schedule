        <h1>Differential effect of auditory and visual associative cues on perceptual inference</h1><h2>Zsófia Pálffy</h2><h3>Bertalan Polner PhD, Department of Cognitive Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics; Kinga Farkas MD PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Semmelweis University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: It is a widely held assumption that the brain performs perceptual inference by combining sensory information with prior expectations, all being weighted by their uncertainty. It has been shown that priors influencing perception of ambiguous stimuli can be manipulated with associative learning. Here, we investigate the differential effect of auditory vs. visual associative cues on visual motion perception and we also examine the reliability of individual differences.<br/><br/>Methods: Healthy individuals (N=29; 14 men, age[SD]=26.6[5.5]) performed a perceptual inference task twice with a one-week delay. They indicated the perceived direction of illusory motion of dot pairs (640 trials). A visuo-acoustic cue preceded the target stimulus and probabilistically predicted the direction of the motion. In 30% of the trials, motion direction was ambiguous, and in half of these trials, the auditory and the visual dimension of the cue predicted opposing directions. Cue-stimulus contingency could change every 40 trials. <br/><br/>Results: Responses were slower to ambiguous, relative to non-ambiguous stimuli. The impact of associative learning on perceptual decisions was evidenced by slower responses to less predictable, relative to more predictable non-ambiguous stimuli and by the increased rate of cue-congruent decisions on ambiguous trials. Importantly, when the visual and the auditory dimensions of the cue predicted conflicting directions of motion on ambiguous trials, participants made more decisions congruent with the prediction of the acoustic dimension. Furthermore, all the above effects had substantial inter-individual variability which showed high test-retest reliability (rs > 0.6).<br/><br/>Discussion: Overall, priors based on auditory information seem to have a stronger weight during the perception of illusory visual motion, although the data suggests large and stable differences in perceptual learning and/or decision making. Computational modelling combined with neuroimaging could allow testing hypotheses regarding the potential mechanisms causing these behavioral effects (e.g. characteristics of visual vs. auditory processing, attention and uncertainty).</p>
