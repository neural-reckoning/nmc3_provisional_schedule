        <h1>Proposal to use neuromorphic architecture to emulate neurological disease progression or neurotoxicity</h1><h2>Thomas Ehmer</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>This is combining topics A and E - and is supposed to be not a real scientific talk but rather an open discussion about the roadmap to achieve a novel instrument which is using multi-scale (bottom up / top down) inputs to emulate ("in mimicko") two things. 1) disease progression and effect of drug to slow the progression - and 2) long-term neurotoxicity side effects. 
Topic1: the progression of neurological disease - over a very long range (computing 1h emulation  - resulting in 10 years "real life progression) for a speedup of 100k (e.g. using Spinnaker)). What is needed is a collaboration from neuroanatomists, pharmaceutics, neuromorphic modelling, neurology medical expertise, behavior modelling as well as a deep understanding of the mechanism of action for both the disease as well as the potential treatment. E.g. monitoring the onset of blurry vision in MS - and delay of this onset by drugs.
Topic2: using the same mechanism to emulate potential long term neurotoxic effects which accumulate over time given "drug exposure". This is more speculative.
The challenge is mapping neuroanatomic details to the emulation - as well as precise mapping of the biochemistry - including blood-brain barrier.  </p>
