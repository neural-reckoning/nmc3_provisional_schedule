        <h1>Auditory stimulation during REM sleep modulates cognitive performance.  </h1><h2>Miguel Navarrete</h2><h3>Miguel Navarrete, Cardiff University; Viviana Greco, Cardiff University; Penelope A. Lewis, Cardiff University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>REM (rapid eye movement) and non-REM (NREM) periods are complementary processes constituting the human sleep. NREM has been found to be essential for declarative memory consolidation. There is no conclusive evidence for the cognitive functions of REM sleep although this stage has been associated to procedural memory and emotional arousal[1]. Recently, auditory stimulation during sleep has emerged as an useful method for manipulation of sleep processes, particularly during NREM[2]. Here, we studied the cognitive effects of auditory stimulation during REM. In two overnight conditions (stimulation vs no-stimulation) for 20 subjects, we studied the effect of auditory stimulation during REM. We recorded overnight polysomnography and short auditory clicks were applied locked to eye-movements in EOG during REM. Then, we evaluated changes of overnight performance for each subject in three cognitive tasks: psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), mirror tracing task (MTT) and visual discrimination task (VDT). Using linear random mixed effects analyses, we found that the stimulation increased sleep efficiency (p=0.048) as well as VDT performance (p=0.0092), but detrimental for MTT (p=0.019) and lessened but not significant for PVT (p=0.069). Likewise, the stimulation decreased the eye-movement density during REM (p=0.04) and induced a broadband beta rhythm (15-30Hz) for about 1s after stimulation. Then, followed by a decrease of theta after 0.75s of the stimulus. Interestingly, the induced beta increase was correlated to performance gain of VDT, whereas phasic REM was also correlated to VDT performance in both overnight conditions.  Our findings indicate that acoustic stimulation provides means to modulate REM sleep. Furthermore, the divergent outcomes for cognitive performance suggest REM dynamics underpin different memory processes in different ways.
