        <h1>Autonomic Dysfunction in Parkinson’s Disease: An Application of Machine Learning for Clinical Diagnosis</h1><h2>Ajay Peddada</h2><h3>Olivier Darbin, University of South Alabama</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by cardinal motor symptoms including tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement. Today, diagnosis relies on the presence of motor symptoms when predominant lesions have already occurred peripherally and centrally. However, nonmotor symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction appear prior to motor symptoms and have the potential to serve as biomarkers for prodromal PD. The goal of the current study is to assess autonomic dysfunction as a possible biomarker in patients with Parkinson’s Disease. <br/><br/>Methods: We measured subjective autonomic symptoms as well as heart rate variability and blood pressure in patients with PD and healthy subjects. The clinical data was analyzed to discriminate between the parkinsonian and healthy state using a suite of machine learning algorithms. The relative importance of different biomarkers was extracted to determine which features of autonomic dysfunction are most predictive of PD. <br/><br/>Results:  Machine learning algorithms attained high accuracy (F1 > 0.80) in classifying between PD and control subjects. Nonlinear features of heart rate variability were the most important features, including Approximate Entropy and the Hurst Exponent. Statistical analysis confirmed significantly lower levels of entropy in patients with PD. PCA achieved lower accuracy (76%) in comparison to the machine learning ensemble. PCA showed that Hurst Exponent and High Frequency spectral power were positively correlated with the parkinsonian state, while Median Instantaneous Frequency and Entropy were negatively correlated with the parkinsonian state. <br/><br/>Conclusions: Machine learning analysis revealed that autonomic dysfunction was highly predictive of PD. The high-ranking performance of nonlinear features suggests that autonomic control is more complex than antagonistic interactions between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Additionally, the effective performance of nonlinear features suggests their utility as biomarkers for early stage PD.  <br/></p>
