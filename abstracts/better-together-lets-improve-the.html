        <h1>Better together: Let’s improve the culture in neuroscience</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neuroscience is a wonderful field, full of excitement, mutual support, and learning from one another. However, the interactions we are having do not always feel positive. People are being bullied, some exploit their privilege, some are being talked down as stereotypes are used. This session is to hear from a number of people how it sometimes does not feel good. And which changes we should make as a field to neuroscience (starting with NMC) move forward productively while being whole more inclusive, positive, and fun.
