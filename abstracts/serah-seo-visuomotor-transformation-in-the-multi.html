However, because neurons work in concert, there is an increasing trend in analyzing multi-unit (MU) activity: the average firing of neurons recorded within the vicinity of a microelectrode.  The goal of this project was to examine the spatial structure embedded in the simultaneously recorded MU activity of the frontal (FEF) and supplementary eye field (SEF) neurons. The spiking activity (visual, memory and motor) of these neurons was recorded during a memory-guided cue-conflict saccade task (where a target-fixed landmark shifted during the delay) by head-unrestrained monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Then, to assess if the MU activity carries the same information as the isolated SU activity, we used a model fitting approach on the MU response fields (RF) along a target (T) to gaze (G) continuum. Similar to the SU activity, the results showed that in both areas: 1) the visual (FEF = 88; SEF = 45) and MU motor (FEF = 90; SEF = 49) activities best coded for target-in-eye (Te) and future gaze-in-eye (Ge) coordinates, respectively. 2) Along the spatiotemporal domain (spanning visual-memory-motor activity), there was a progressive transition from T to G coding. 3) In the FEF, along the T-G continuum, MU activity better predicted the gaze than SU activity (p < 0.05), suggesting the robustness of population signals. In conclusion, these results suggest that: 1) neurons work in coordination with overlapping RFs and 2) the MU activity can be used as a reliable indicator of the visuomotor tasks. This has potential for translational purposes in medical settings to detect functional/dysfunctional sensorimotor transformations. </p>
