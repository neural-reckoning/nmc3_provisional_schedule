        <h1>Learning and attention increase neuronal response selectivity in mouse primary visual cortex through distinct mechanisms</h1><h2>Adil Khan</h2><h3>Jasper Poort; Katharina Wilmes; Antonin Blot; Angus Chadwick; Maneesh Sahani; Claudia Clopath; Thomas Mrsic-Flogel; Sonja Hofer</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Response selectivity of cortical neurons can increase for behaviorally relevant stimuli across days as animals learn a novel stimulus-reward association, and across seconds when animals transiently attend to sensory stimuli. While both phenomena can act on the same cortical circuit, it is unknown whether they rely on the same mechanisms. We imaged activity of the same neuronal populations in primary visual cortex as mice learned a visual discrimination task and subsequently performed an attentional switching task. Selectivity changes due to learning and attention were largely uncorrelated at the single-cell level. Selectivity increases after learning were mainly due to selective suppression of responses to one of the task relevant stimuli but relied on both selective enhancement and suppression during attention. Furthermore, learning and attention differentially affected interactions between excitatory and different inhibitory cell classes. Circuit modelling revealed that cell class specific top-down inputs best explained attention modulation, while reorganization of local functional connectivity accounts for specific learning related changes. These results suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie increased discriminability of relevant sensory stimuli across longer and shorter time scales.</p>
