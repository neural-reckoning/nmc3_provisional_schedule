However, to date, this has been demonstrated predominantly in studies with non-sustained task demands. Here, we revisited the transient vs. sustained nature of sensorimotor beta activity in an isometric contraction task designed to yield sustained behavioural output. During sustained muscle contraction, beta activity in sensorimotor cortices is known to become coherent with the muscle, resulting in cortico-muscular coherence (CMC). We hypothesised that if CMC is responsible for sustained motor contraction, beta activity should be sustained in this context. We measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electromyography (EMG) while participants (N = 18) performed a sustained motor task (gripping). To accurately disentangle the burst vs. sustained oscillation scenarios, we analysed MEG time-series in motor channels with Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) – a data-driven signal decomposition method with high temporal resolution. We replicated the finding that beta activity is modulated by global task structure: beta power in motor brain areas and the muscle was particularly prominent while participants held a steady grip. Correspondingly, we observed beta CMC during gripping. Nevertheless, at the single trial level, beta activity in the brain and the muscle appeared transient. When collapsing all periods of high and low beta power in the brain (beta ON and OFF periods), we confirmed that transient ON periods in the brain were paralleled by a corresponding short-lasting increase in beta power in the muscle and by a similarly time-limited CMC, despite sustained motor output. These transient beta ON periods were not due to transient changes in participants’ grip. We finally found that beta “bursts” during gripping were of similarly short duration as those recorded in the same participants during rest. Together, these findings show that beta activity and connectivity is “bursty” even during sustained motor output.</p>
