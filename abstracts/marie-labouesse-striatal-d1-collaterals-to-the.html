        <h1>Striatal D1 collaterals to the GPe act as a second direct pathway to regulate motor coordination</h1><h2>Marie Labouesse</h2><h3>Marie A. Labouesse, Columbia University; Joseph Villarin, Columbia University; Arturo Torres, Columbia University; Xiaoiao Sun, Columbia University; Fernanda de Carvalho, Columbia University; Sherry Lam, NIH/NIDA; Jordi Bonaventura, NIH/NIDA, Michael Michaelides, NIH/NIDA; Savio Chan, Northwestern University; Ofer Yizhar, Weizmann Institute of Science; Christoph Kellendonk, Columbia University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In the classical model of the basal ganglia two segregated and functionally opposing pathways arise from the striatum to regulate motor control. Direct pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs) expressing dopamine D1 receptors (D1R) project monosynaptically to the substantia nigra (SNr) to promote movement while indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) expressing D2R project monosynaptically to the globus pallidus externus (GPe) to oppose movement. Recent functional studies, however, reveal that during native movements both pathways are activated. Moreover, anatomical and physiological studies have put into question the organization of the basal ganglia. For instance, we and others have shown that a large fraction of dSPNs possess axon collaterals within the GPe. These “bridging” collaterals are plastic in the adult animal and regulated by D2Rs and neuronal activity. These findings, though indirect, suggested an important role of dSPN bridging collaterals in regulating the balance of the direct and indirect pathway and motor function. Here, we used a combination of genetic targeting, calcium in vivo imaging, dSPN terminal-specific manipulations and behavioral tracking (DeepLabCut) to determine the role of dSPN bridging collaterals in motor function. We found that dSPN bridging collaterals were activated during specific movements in the rotarod. dSPN terminal inhibition also decreased locomotion and impaired rotarod performance. Recent physiology work shows that dSPNs preferentially target the non-canonical, striatal-backprojecting, arkypallidal Npas1 neurons in the GPe. We here found that stimulation of dSPNs inhibited Npas1 neurons in awake behaving mice. Finally, we found that Npas1 stimulation recapitulated the effects of dSPN inhibition by decreasing locomotion and rotarod function. We propose a model by which dSPN bridging collaterals support movement via inhibition of Npas1 neurons in the GPe. Thus, direct pathway GPe terminals act in concert with the canonical terminals in the SNr by inhibiting a potential stop signal going back to the striatum.</p>
