        <h1>Efficient coding in auditory cortex determines target detection behavior</h1><h2>Chris Angeloni</h2><h3>Chris Angeloni, University of Pennsylvania; Wiktor Mlynarski, IST Austria; Katherine Wood, University of Pennsylvania; Linda Garami, University of Pennsylvania; Anne Hermundstadt, Janelia HHMI; Maria Geffen, University of Pennsylvania</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Sensory systems are composed of neurons with limited dynamic range, but are required to accurately represent a world in which the dynamic range of incoming stimuli can vary wildly. To efficiently encode acoustic environments with different dynamic ranges (referred to here as contrast), neurons in auditory cortex (AC) adapt the gain of their response function to effectively match their dynamic range to that of the environment. However, it is not known whether these widespread changes in neural sensitivity have an impact on auditory percepts. To test this, we trained mice to detect auditory targets in backgrounds of different contrasts, and find that, 1) target detection and sensitivity were improved in low contrast, and, 2) the time-course of target detectability varied depending on contrast, decreasing rapidly after a transition to high contrast, and increasing at a slower rate after a transition to low contrast. These patterns of target detectability are recapitulated in populations of AC neurons simultaneously recorded with behavior and the magnitude of gain modulation in cortical neurons predicts behavioral performance of individual mice. Consistent with these results, a normative model in which neurons efficiently adapt their gain to optimize stimulus reconstruction also exhibits detection performance in line with our behavioral and neural results. Together, these results demonstrate that efficient neural codes in auditory cortex directly influence behavioral percepts.</p>
