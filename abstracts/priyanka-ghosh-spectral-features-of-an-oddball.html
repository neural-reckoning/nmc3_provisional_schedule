        <h1>Spectral features of an oddball task across modalities</h1><h2>Priyanka Ghosh</h2><h3>Arpan Banerjee, National Brain Research Center</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>P300 complex is associated with cognitive processes such as attention and mem-
ory.An oddball paradigm in which,a deviant stimulus is infrequently presented
amidst a sequence of standard repetitive stimuli,typically exhibits a positive
peak in the event related potential recording via electroencephalogram(EEG)
at a latency of around 300ms from the onset of the stimulus.This study explores
the spectral features of the P3 complex ERP and the underlying cortical areas
involved in its generation,across unimodal and multimodal using 2 stimuli odd-
ball paradigms.Further,we extrapolate to study the spectral changes acquired
through 2 stimuli oddball paradigm,in which both the stimuli are of a different
modalities.Consequently,we compare our empirical results and try to answer
whether the P3 complex is modality specific and how does it vary spectrally
and spatially(underlying cortical generators).</p>
