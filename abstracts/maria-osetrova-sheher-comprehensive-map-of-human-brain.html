        <h1>Comprehensive map of human brain lipidome</h1><h2>Maria Osetrova (she/her)</h2><h3>Anna Tkachev, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Elena Stekolschikova, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Aleksandra Mitina, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Olga Efimova, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Ekaterina Khrameeva Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology; Philipp Khaitovich Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The lipid composition of brain anatomical structures remains poorly understood, particularly in humans and closely related non-human primates. In addition, lipids are often assumed to be exclusively structural elements of the brain, and their functionality remains poorly studied on the scale of the whole brain. In our work, we describe the generation and analysis of a lipidome atlas of the healthy adult human brain.<br/>Analysis of the lipid composition of 75 regions of the brain of 4 healthy individuals using high-performance liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry resulted in 3573 high-quality peaks, as well as a subset of 503 manually annotated lipid species covering 20 lipid classes. A comparison of lipid data with the structural and functional MRI of the brain revealed groups of lipids associated with the white and the gray matter of the brain, as well as a group of function-associated lipids.<br/>Statistically significant differences in the behavior of different lipids species in different areas of the brain, discovered in this work, can be associated with cytoarchitectural diversity. Moreover, similarities to the functional architecture of the brain make lipids a potential target for the diagnosis of mental disorders.<br/>Thus, comparative analysis of the lipid composition of the brain of patients with schizophrenia showed that the greatest changes occur in the lipids associated with the white matter of the brain, as well as lipids associated with the functional activity of the brain.</p>
