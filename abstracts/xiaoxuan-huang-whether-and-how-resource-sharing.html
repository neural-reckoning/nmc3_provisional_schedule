However, a large number of studies have shown that uncommon sharing behavior could still be observed in the condition of resource scarcity. Itâ€™s unclear how resource sharing persists under shortage. In the present study, we suggested that empathy has accounted for the inconsistent and heterogeneous results in literatures of sharing decision. Here we combined a novel within-subject paradigm- participant who own resource decided whether and how to share their survival resources with the other participant who has no resource-with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and intranasal oxytocin to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of sharing behavior under resource scarcity. At the behavioral level, we found that people kept more resources for themselves under insufficient condition relative to sufficient condition. And the stability of sharing behavior was significantly correlated with the cognitive empathy(CE) score (r = -0.48, p < 0.01). At the neural level, we found activation in the left and right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) were suppressed while the bilateral inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) were enhanced in insufficient condition comparing to sufficient condition. Psychophysiological Interactions (PPI) further suggested that the functional connectivity from lIOG to rTPJ was positively associated with the stability of sharing behavior. Oxytocin experiment provided evidence that high CE participants receiving oxytocin showed a lower changing rate than those receiving placebo while the low CE participants show no oxytocin effect. These findings suggest cognitive empathy trait and the lIOG-rTPJ neural connectivity play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of sharing behavior under scarcity, and oxytocin may strengthen the relationship between the two.</p>
