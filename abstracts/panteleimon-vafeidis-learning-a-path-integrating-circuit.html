        <h1>Learning a Path-Integrating Circuit of the Drosophila Central Complex</h1><h2>Panteleimon Vafeidis</h2><h3>Pantelis Vafidis, Computation and Neural Systems, Division of Biology and Biological Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, United States; Tiziano D'Albis, Institute for Theoretical Biology, Department of Biology, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany; David Owald, Institute of Neurophysiology, Charite – Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany; Richard Kempter, Institute for Theoretical Biology, Department of Biology, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany; </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Head direction cells are neurons that respond selectively to a specific head orientation in space. They are organized in a recurrent network, where the current head orientation is represented by a localized bump of neuronal activity. Path integration in the context of head direction cells is moving this bump of activity around the network respecting the animal's current head orientation, while using only self-motion cues. The one-dimensional ring attractor has been a popular approach to model the network of head direction cells, and one of the most long-lived attractor network models in Computational Neuroscience. Furthermore, this model has recently received experimental support in the fly's head direction system. However, it remains to date unclear how a path integrating circuit of head direction cells could self-organize through synaptic plasticity. Previous models showed circuits that either needed parameter tuning after training, or used biologically implausible learning rules. </p>
