        <h1>The study of auditory-vocal load on drivers’ performance.</h1><h2>Seyedehsara hejazi</h2><h3>Masoumeh Korousharami, Mohamadsadegh Ghasemi</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent years in all over the world, car accidents are account for many fatalities and deaths. There are several causes for car accidents such as driver distraction, sleepiness, fatigue and etc. In this paper, driver distraction is under focus. On the other hand, role of passengers is neglected in many studies, while in real situation passengers play significant role in drivers' distraction. In this research, conversations between passenger and driver are considered as auditory- vocal load as secondary tasks. Methodology: There are 20 healthy people young and experienced drivers  (23-45 years old) participated in simulated driving experiment. Each of them passed pre-test (baseline driving) and four level of conversation including general, emotional, second language and problem solving in main experiment. Also DALI as a subjective teat carried out to reflect participant attitude toward the test.                                                                                                                              Results: Results demonstrated that speed and reaction time increased under emotional and problem solving conversations there was significant change in speed and reaction time.      Conclusion: secondary auditory and vocal task may result in drivers’ distraction which can negatively affect driver performances.</p>
