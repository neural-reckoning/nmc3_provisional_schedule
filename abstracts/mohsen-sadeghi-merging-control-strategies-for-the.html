        <h1>Merging control strategies for the manipulation of complex objects</h1><h2>Mohsen Sadeghi</h2><h3>Dagmar Sternad</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Skilful object manipulation often combines different movement elements to achieve specific task goals. When swirling a glass of wine, the primary goal of control is to bring the wine (internal degree of freedom) into a rhythmic circular motion, whereas when bringing the glass of wine to the mouth, the main goal is to translate the glass itself. Smooth transition of control goals, from rhythmic to discrete, or from internal to external degrees of freedom, exemplifies the remarkable dexterity in manipulation, yet remains hardly explored. <br/>This study developed a novel paradigm to examine how humans combine such control goals when manipulating an object with internal dynamics, akin to swirling a glass of wine. Subjects grasped the handle of a custom-designed cup with a ball rolling inside, and rhythmically "swirled" the ball close to the rim, while remaining within a specified "home position". An audible cue signalled subjects to translate the cup in a reach-like movement to a target position. Such discrete translation could interrupt the ball rotation or cause the ball to fall out. Subjects were instructed to keep the ball rotation as steady as possible during and after the reach. Dependent measures were the amplitude and frequency of ball rotation and their deviation/error from a perfect circular motion, the ball phase when initiating the translation, and the duration of the translation.<br/>With practice, subjects achieved smooth transitions between rhythmic (ball) and discrete (cup) movements by jointly modulating the ball phase at translation initiation, and the duration of the translation. These findings suggest that the motor system learns to merge the control goals by integrating the discrete cup movement into the rhythmic cycle of the ball rotation. The observed behaviour is discussed in the context of optimal control theory and dynamic primitives for the control of complex actions. </p>
