        <h1>The impact of short-term motor imagery training on the brain</h1><h2>Wang Youhao</h2><h3>Youhao Wang</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background: in recent years, the combined application of motor imagery and brain computer interface (BCI) technology has attracted extensive attention and obtained good research results in the field of neural rehabilitation. However, this BCI-based motor imagery therapy with real-time neural feedback has not been deeply explored. This paper will analyze the brain changes before and after the motor imagery training mission in a short time from the two perspectives of brain ERD attenuation and ERP connectivity.<br/>Method: The subjects were trained with or without visual feedback. Firstly, we analyze the changes of EEG signal attenuation during motor imagery based on brain ERD phenomenon in a short period of time. Then we introduce the connectivity index of brain network based on graph theory, and discuss the influence of motor imagery training with or without neural feedback on the brain in three scales (single node scale, regional scale and whole brain scale).<br/>Results: we found that the attenuation of EEG signal increased before and after motor imagery training whether or not nerve feedback was introduced. In the analysis of brain network, we found that the group with neural feedback has more obvious connectivity attenuation than the group without feedback.<br/>Conclusion: we discussed the influence of BCI motor imagery with or without nerve feedback on brain from two aspects of ERD attenuation degree and ERP connectivity change. The results showed that the changes of indexes in the group with nerve feedback were more obvious and had more uniform trend attributes. This provides a good reference for the follow-up research.</p>
