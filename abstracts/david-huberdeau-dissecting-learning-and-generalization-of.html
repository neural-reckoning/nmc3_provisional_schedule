        <h1>Dissecting learning and generalization of a continuous motor skill using a customized videogame</h1><h2>David Huberdeau</h2><h3>Adrian M. Haith, Johns Hopkins University; John W. Krakauer, Johns Hopkins University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>How humans learn continuous motor skills, like a tennis serve, is a topic of great interest but remains controversial. One theory is that continuous movements in humans are made up of a sequence of discrete movement primitives. Movement primitives become sequenced into chunks that are then executed more efficiently. One prediction from the chunking model is that learning is sequence-specific, i.e. learning of one sequence of movements does not benefit the performance of a different sequence. We sought to test the chunking model by comparing the movement kinematics of continuous movements that were either well practiced or unpracticed. Human participants learned a continuous-movement skill that was implemented in a custom-built videogame. The game recorded participants’ movements as they learned to drive a virtual car along a narrow and winding track (the training track) by tilting a tablet computer using both wrists. To test for generalization, participants navigated a new track, the probe track, in a block of trials on their final day of participation. The probe track was the mirror-image of the training track, and so was matched for difficulty. Under the chunking model, performance on the probe track should have worsened compared to the training track. However, movement kinematics on the probe track matched those recorded on the training track, revealing that participants fully generalized. Performance, however, as measured by task success (remaining within the track boundaries) was worse for the probe track. Performance may transiently worsen compared to an individual’s average performance due to lapses, and an analysis of kinematics prior to task failure indicated that failures occurred in the same way on both tracks, while the frequency of lapses was higher on the probe. These findings are more consistent with learning a general control policy based on visited states rather than a chunked movement sequence. </p>
