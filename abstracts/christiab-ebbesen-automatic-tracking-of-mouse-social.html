        <h1>Automatic tracking of mouse social posture dynamics by 3D videography, deep learning and GPU-accelerated robust optimization</h1><h2>Christiab Ebbesen</h2><h3>Christian L. Ebbesen, New York University; Robert C. Froemke, New York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Social interactions powerfully impact both the brain and the body, but high-resolution descriptions of these important physical interactions are lacking. Currently, most studies of social behavior rely on labor-intensive methods such as manual annotation of individual video frames. These methods are susceptible to experimenter bias and have limited throughput. To understand the neural circuits underlying social behavior, scalable and objective tracking methods are needed. We present a hardware/software system that combines 3D videography, deep learning, physical modeling and GPU-accelerated robust optimization. Our system is capable of fully automatic multi-animal tracking during naturalistic social interactions and allows for simultaneous electro-physiological recordings. We capture the posture dynamics of multiple unmarked mice with high spatial (âˆ¼2 mm) and temporal precision (60 frames/s). This method is based on inexpensive consumer cameras and is implemented in python, making our method cheap and straightforward to adopt and customize for studies of neurobiology and animal behavior.</p>
