        <h1>Neural mechanisms underlying temperature-driven host seeking by a skin-penetrating human-parasitic nematode</h1><h2>Astra Bryant (she, her)</h2><h3>Felicitas Ruiz, UCLA; Elissa Hallem, UCLA</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Skin-penetrating parasitic nematodes are a major source of “diseases of disadvantage,” infecting approximately 1 billion people. Their life cycle includes an infective third-larval (iL3) stage that searches for hosts in a poorly understood process involving thermal cues. We measured temperature-driven behaviors in multiple parasitic-nematode species, including the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. We found that mammalian-parasitic iL3s are highly sensitive to thermal gradients. At temperatures above their cultivation temperature, iL3s display robust attraction to mammalian body temperatures (37°C). Temperature-driven responses are dominant in multisensory contexts; when below host body temperature, iL3s prioritize temperature-driven behaviors over chemosensory attraction to host odors. <br/><br/>We leveraged the genetic similarities between S. stercoralis and the free-living model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate mechanisms underlying temperature-driven host seeking. For C. elegans, thermotaxis behaviors within their physiological temperature range (~15-25°C) depend on the Ce-tax-4 gene, which encodes a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit. We showed that targeted mutagenesis of Ss-tax-4 abolishes iL3 heat seeking, suggesting this behavior is generated through adaptations of conserved molecular cascades. In C. elegans, AFD sensory neurons provide the primary thermosensory drive for thermotaxis navigation. We genetically identified the S. stercoralis AFD neurons, and found that inducible silencing of these neurons suppresses iL3 heat seeking. Thus, AFD’s thermosensory role is conserved between S. stercoralis and C. elegans despite species-specific differences in thermal preference, behavior, and AFD dendritic structure. Using genetically encoded calcium sensors, we found that temperature-driven responses in Ss-AFD are distinct from those in Ce-AFD. Furthermore, at least two Ss-AFD-specific receptor guanylate cyclases confer sensitivity to temperature ranges that include mammalian body temperatures, compared to only one in C. elegans. Thus, altered thermal encoding in primary thermosensory neurons likely contributes to parasite-specific behaviors. Together, our results provide insight into the behavioral strategies, neural circuits, and molecular mechanisms that allow skin-penetrating nematodes to target hosts.</p>
