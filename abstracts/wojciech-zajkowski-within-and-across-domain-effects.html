        <h1>Within and across domain effects of choice-induced bias</h1><h2>Wojciech Zajkowski</h2><h3>Wojciech Zajkowski, Cardiff University; Jiaxiang Zhang, Cardiff University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent evidence suggests choices influence evaluation, giving rise to choice-induced confirmation bias. It is however unknown whether this phenomenon is constrained to the domain of choice, or spans across domains, allowing a decision to influence evaluation of unrelated item-specific information. 
Here, we intermix value-based and perceptual choices and evaluations of a set of appetitive stimuli to study both within and across domain effects of choices on value estimation. In a set of 5 experiments (4 preregistered, total of 425 participants) we find strong and consistent evidence for both within and across domain effects of choice induced bias in both domains. This means perceptual choices influenced subjective appetitive value, and value-based choices influenced perceived size.
The effect is stronger for value-based estimations, and for domain-congruent choices. The bias is driven to a greater extent by devaluing rejected items, is specific to endogenous (self-generated) choices, and cannot be explained by positive evidence bias. Our generative model of choice-driven value fluctuation reveals that only within-domain effects are long lasting. 
These findings reveal that the act of free choice influences the estimation of  both choice-relevant and irrelevant attributes of the chosen item, providing further insight into how choices shape internal values.
