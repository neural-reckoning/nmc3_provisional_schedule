        <h1>Effects of Traumatic Brain Injury on the structure of BA4a and BA4p</h1><h2>Isabella Kaczmarczyk</h2><h3>Nikhil Sharma, University College London, Francesco Grillo, University College London</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Introduction: ALS is a universally fatal neurodegenerative disorder with no effective treatment. Recent reports (NEJM) suggest that subjects with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are 4 times more likely to develop ALS than non-TBI subjects. It is not clear why TBI should increase the incidence of ALS. The cortico-motoneurones - which originate in the posterior part of the motor cortex (BA4p) - have long been implicated in ALS. It is conceivable that TBI selectively damages BA4p that predisposes individuals to ALS. We hypothesised that subjects with TBI would have low grey matter density in the left BA4p compared to BA4a in TBI patients versus non-TBI. <br/><br/>Methods: We used the open ADNI-DOD data set (https://ida.loni.usc.edu/login.jsp?project=ADNIDOD). Vietnam War Veterans (mean age = 68.8, ADNI-DOD) with a history of war-related TBI (n=55) and those without TBI (n=34) were included in the study. We initially explored the parcellation of the motor cortex into BA4a and BA4p regions from Freesurfer (5.3.0). <br/><br/>Results: Our preliminary results show the total BA4 thickness in the left hemisphere was smaller, but does not show a significant decrease in thickness (t = 0.731, p-value = 0.4667) in TBI versus nTBI. The cortical thickness in the LH BA4p seem to show more thinning however this was not statistically significant compared to the LH BA4a or to control regions, in the initial sMRI analysis (BA4p, t = 1.2546, p-value = 0.2136; BA4a, t = 1.2546, p-value = 0.9503)<br/><br/>Conclusions: We report that the structures of the subdivisions of BA4 are differentially affected by TBI, implicating that the BA4p structure may be more critical in the development of motor neurone disease. <br/>Results are preliminary-Future work will refine this further by examining the subdivision of the motor cortex using other imaging modalities suggest at fMRI & DTI. </p>
