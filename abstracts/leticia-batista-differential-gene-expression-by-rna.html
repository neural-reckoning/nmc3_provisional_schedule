It is know that its pathogenesis is multifactorial, despite not well elucidated. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal model organism to dissect molecular pathways, here used to dissect the differential gene expression during AD’s progression due to the amylodoigenic pathway using RNA-seq. A total of 1388 genes were found as differentially expressed both as AD progressed and in control flies. The main pathways related to those genes were evaluated using fly genes and human orthologs, linking genomic and higher order functional information. We identified alterations in pathways related to metabolism, ribosomal pathways, proteasome pathways and immune system. Some of those genes were validated by qPCR and in vivo knockdown. The identification of molecular pathway similarities between the transgenic Alzheimer-like fly model identified in this work and its human orthologs may provides new insights for the use of this fly in screening novel anti-AD drugs.</p>
