Finn, Indiana University; Joshua W Brown, Indiana University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Current studies of addiction involve decision making tasks with money or other non-drug rewards. However, previous research has shown that addiction changes response to drug vs non-drug rewards. Studies using drug reward have not given drugs as an instrumental reward directly in the MRI scanner. In this study, we looked at the neural representations of risk and reward associated with nicotine vs. money. We used a modified e-cigarette to deliver nicotine vapor to subjects with nicotine dependence inside the fMRI scanner. Our novel gambling task orthogonalized the gamble characteristics: variance in outcomes, probability of failure, and the expected value of the outcomes. This allowed us to evaluate their effects separately. The outcome in the case of a nicotine gamble was the duration of nicotine vapor inhalation and in the case of money gamble, it was the amount of money in dollars. We found an effect of greater nicotine reward anticipation in the cingulate gyrus and caudate. Regions in the motor cortex were active during nicotine inhalation, as was expected. The psychophysiological interaction analysis with these motor regions as seeds revealed increased functional connectivity with right middle temporal gyrus during inhalation. We also observed a striking reversal of effects in the cingulate cortex between money and nicotine rewards, in distinct but overlapping clusters. Activation was greater for monetary loss than win, but in contrast, activation was greater when subjects obtained nicotine than when they failed to obtain it. Activities correlating with the variance and probability of loss of a monetary gamble were found in various regions in the frontal cortex and temporal lobe. The results contribute to our knowledge of regions involved in decisions about nicotine when the nicotine reward could be realized immediately and provide insights into the limitations of non-drug rewards in studying addiction. </p>
