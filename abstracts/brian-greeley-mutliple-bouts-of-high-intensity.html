        <h1>Mutliple bouts of high intensity exercise and its effect on resting state functional connectivity and implicit motor learning in healthy older adults</h1><h2>Brian Greeley</h2><h3>Brian Greeley, University of British Columbia; Briana Chau, University of British Columbia; Christy C. Jones, University of British Columbia; Lara A. Boyd, University of British Columbia</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Older adults show both age-related decreases in resting state functional connectivity and sensorimotor function. Aerobic exercise has emerged as a potential intervention that may mitigate or even reverse these age-related declines. However, studies that have touted the impact of exercise on resting state functional connectivity or motor learning have done so focusing on one of these two dependent measures alone. Here we sought to understand whether exercise influences both resting state functional connectivity, and motor acquisition and learning in the same population of older adults. Forty-two healthy older adults rested or completed high intensity aerobic exercise for 23 minutes, then immediately practiced a complex, implicit motor task with their non-dominant hand across five separate sessions. Participants were also scanned before the first and after the fifth day of practice, and returned 24-hours and 35-days following their fifth day of practice to complete short- and long-term retention tests of behavioural change. Independent component analysis revealed increased connectivity in the frontoparietal network, the dorsal attentional network, and the cerebellar network in the exercise group. Seed-based analysis revealed strengthened connectivity between the limbic system and right cerebellum, between right lobule 9 and the right middle temporal gyrus, and between right lobule 10 and bilateral middle temporal gyri. There were no group implicit motor learning differences during acquisition or at either retention test. Overall, these data suggest that either exercise alone, or exercise paired with a novel implicit motor learning task augment resting state functional connectivity but do not enhance behavioural change beyond that stimulated by skilled motor practice in older healthy adults.  </p>
