        <h1>Emergence of collective oscillations in balanced neural networks due to intrinsic fluctuations </h1><h2>Matteo Di Volo</h2><h3>Di Volo Matteo, LPTM, University of Cergy Pontoise, Cergy, France; Torcini Alessandro, LPTM, University of Cergy Pontoise, Cergy, France</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>We report a transition from asynchronous to oscillatory behavior in balanced  inhibitory sparse neuronal networks with instantaneous synapses. Collective oscillations emerge for sufficiently connected networks. Their origin is understood in terms of a recently developed mean-field model for sparse balanced neural networks. Collective oscillations are induced by irregular microscopic neural firing, due to balance. The same mechanism induces in balanced excitatory-inhibitory networks quasiperiodic collective oscillations.
