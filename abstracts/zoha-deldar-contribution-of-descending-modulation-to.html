        <h1>Contribution of descending modulation to load-dependant reduction of pain by working memory</h1><h2>Zoha  Deldar</h2><h3>Isabelle Blanchette; Mathieu Pich√©</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Working memory (WM) engagement produces pain inhibition. However, it remains unclear whether higher WM load increases this effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the interaction between WM load and pain inhibition by WM and examine the contribution of descending inhibition. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers were assigned to one of two n-back groups for which WM load was different (2-back or 3-back). The experimental protocol comprised five counterbalanced conditions (0-back, n-back, pain, 0-back with pain, and n-back with pain). Pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) were evoked by transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the sural nerve. Pain was significantly different between conditions, but not between n-back groups. Both the 0-back and n-back tasks reduced pain compared with pain alone, but the n-back task produced stronger pain inhibition compared with the 0-back task. NFR amplitude was significantly different between conditions but not between n-back groups. NFR was inhibited by the 0-back and n-back tasks, with no difference between the two tasks. These findings indicate that pain inhibition by WM is increased by WM load, but only to a certain point. NFR inhibition by WM suggests that inhibition of pain by WM depends, at least in part, on descending inhibition.</p>
