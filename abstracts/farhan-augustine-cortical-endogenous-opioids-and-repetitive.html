        <h1>Cortical Endogenous Opioids and Repetitive Behaviors in Deer Mice</h1><h2>Farhan Augustine</h2><h3>Shawn Doss, Johns Hopkins University; Harvey S. Singer, Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Goal: Our research aims to understand the pathophysiologic mechanism(s) underlying human movement disorders. 

Background: Repetitive movement disorders, such as tics and stereotypies, are common in the pediatric population. Although alterations in cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits may be involved, there are numerous unanswered questions. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) provide a non-pharmacologically induced model for studying underlying mechanisms. 

Methodology: Investigative approaches, to date, have included stereological studies designed to identify anatomical alterations in the cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, and techniques that quantify regional neurotransmitters (e.g., LC-MS and RNAscope).  
Results: Stereological studies have identified a significant negative correlation between cell count in the ventral striatum and repetitive activity. Neurochemically, a significant negative correlation was observed between the repetitive activity of deer mice and the LC-MS/MS quantified endogenous opioids (leu-enkephalin (enk) and dynorphin-A (dyn-A) in the frontal cortex (FC) [Augustine et al. 2020]. Based on these findings, we have postulated that endogenous opioids in the cortex regulate the balance of activity within cortical-striatal pathways, either via goal-directed/habitual pathways, direct/indirect systems, or inhibitory circuits. For example, the FC originates habitual behaviors via cortical projections to striatal medium-spiny-neurons (MSNs) that participate in the DRD1-expressing (direct) and DRD2-expressing (indirect) motor pathways. 

Current Studies: Studies in progress, using in-situ mRNA hybridization, are designed to examine the dopaminergic and endogenous opioid systems in the striatum and FC. To date, we have quantified the mRNA expression levels of DRD1/DRD2 and the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors (MOR, DOR, and KOR, respectively) in the FC and striatal regions. Preliminary data shows a negative correlation between the repetitive behavior activity and mRNA expression of dyn-A and enk in the FC, further supporting our initial report proposing a role for endogenous opioids as an underlying mechanism for repetitive behaviors.</p>
