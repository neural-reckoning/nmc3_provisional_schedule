        <h1>Comparing 7T sequences to image human basal ganglia activity during performance on a visual cueing task</h1><h2>Kelly Garner</h2><h3>Christopher Nolan, University of Queensland; Ole Jensen, University of Birmingham; Markus Barth, University of Queensland; Marta Garrido, University of Melbourne</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Although it is well established that expectations influence visual selection, our mapping of the neurophysiological infrastructure that instantiates this influence remains incomplete. Two known influences on visual selection; probabilistic and value-based learning, have been associated with the function of the human basal ganglia, yet the sensitivity of these nuclei to visual selection demands remains unknown. Imaging the activity of the basal-ganglia is a challenge, as the iron-rich nuclei suffer signal loss when using conventional imaging sequences. We therefore sought to determine which echo-planar imaging (EPI) parameters yield the best signal in the basal ganglia when participants perform a visual cueing task that pits spatial probabilities against reward incentives in relation to upcoming visual targets. We compared three sequences designed for use with 7T Magnetic Resonance Imaging, that sought to balance high spatial and temporal resolution with full brain coverage, varying in slice acceleration factors and echo times. Importantly, we compared the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between sequences when both spatial probabilities and incentive-values influenced upcoming target discrimination performance, and when comparing the hand of response, which is in-line with the typical contrast used to determine optimal parameters for imaging the basal ganglia. We find that the sequence that provides the best CNR under varying visual selection manipulations is not the same as that found for the motoric contrast. Therefore, optimal imaging parameters for the basal ganglia during experiments that assess visual and cognitive manipulations may differ from the optimal parameters for imaging motoric-related activity. </p>
