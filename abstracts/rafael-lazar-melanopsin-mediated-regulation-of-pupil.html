        <h1>Melanopsin-mediated regulation of pupil size in natural vision</h1><h2>Rafael Lazar</h2><h3>Dr Manuel Spitschan</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In humans, steady-state pupil size is largely determined by the activity of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the short-wavelength-sensitive photopigment melanopsin (Î»max = 480 nm). From well-controlled laboratory studies employing parametric stimuli, we know that radiance drives the size of the pupil, with higher melanopic radiance associated with smaller pupil size, but at present there is no established data set for variations in pupil size in real-world light exposure. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to assess the light input regulating steady-state pupil size under dynamic, real-world conditions. We integrated a wearable infrared video-based eye tracker (Pupil Labs GmbH) with a small-scale spectroradiometer (Ocean Insight Inc.). Both devices were attached to a bespoke 3D-printed adjustable head mount and connected to a miniature, battery-driven control computer (Raspberry Pi), enabling simultaneous sampling of pupil size and spectral irradiance at 10-sec intervals. We measured natural variation in pupil size across two protocols, in which healthy, young participants (n=7; age: 20-30 years) moved in and between indoor and outdoor environments varying in light conditions and engaged in a range of everyday tasks. We successfully measured variation in pupil size as a function of near-corneal melanopic irradiance in the real world, yielding distinct dose-response curves for each participant. Under these uncontrolled conditions, data retention was reasonably high (~65% data retained; total number of usable spectrum and pupil size pairs: 6620). In line with the sluggish properties of melanopsin signalling, pupil size was more accurately predicted by integrating preceding melanopic irradiance values (60-sec window) than the simultaneous samples. In summary, we demonstrate a robust paradigm for conducting ambulatory research measuring melanopsin-mediated physiological signals in humans outside of the laboratory.</p>
