        <h1>Dendritic and synaptic inhomogeneity patterns between pyramidals as a complementary mechanism for flexible coding in PFC.</h1><h2>Stefanos Stamatiades</h2><h3>Stefanos Stefanou, IMBB,FORTH, Department of Biology, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete; Athanasia Papoutsi, IMBB,FORTH;  Panayiota Poirazi, IMBB,FORTH; </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) displays flexibility in decision making, compared to other cortical areas. Also, it contains non perfectly tuned neurons, responding in a variable way. Yet can robustly discriminate and maintain memoranda in working memory (WM). We investigate the effect of synaptic and dendritic mechanisms, in a PFC model network during a WM task simulation, to establish a link between these mechanisms and discrimination and maintenance of WM memoranda. 
We propose the dendritic and synaptic inhomogeneity patterns between PFC pyramidals as a complementary mechanism for flexible coding in PFC, sufficient for performing stimulus dependent shifts of network activity, ultimately to be utilized downstream for different behavior. We do so by probing the spatial arrangement of synaptic inputs on a variable number of dendrites. Finally, we explore the structured, highly reciprocal PFC connectivity as an optimal neural connectivity substrate, best exploiting the dendritic and synaptic inhomogeneities for the above-mentioned computations. 
Our results show that the combination of dendritic and synaptic inhomogeneities and structured, highly reciprocal connectivity can enable a single PFC recurrent network model to rapidly discriminate and maintain memoranda, despite the variable individual neuronal responses. We report that the network can rapidly shift between different transient, yet robustly discriminable activity trajectories, that are maintained during post-stimulus epoch. Also, we show that the above connectivity predicts the best PFC WM storage ability, compared with a non-optimal i.e. non-biologically correct network connectivity.
