        <h1>A motor adaptation paradigm to strengthen implicit learning</h1><h2>Shanaathanan Modchalingam</h2><h3>Shanaathanan Modchalingam, York University; Marco Ciccone, York University; Bernard Marius â€™t Hart, York University; Denise Henriques, York University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>When our intended movements have unintended outcomes, the human motor system can quickly adapt future movements. Motor output is modified in a way such that motor errors, that is, the difference between the expected and the perceived consequences of any motor output, are reduced. Both explicit and implicit neural processes play key roles in adaptation. Explicit processes, such as the effortful use of conscious strategies to counter a perturbation, can be quickly employed and allow for flexibility in rapidly changing conditions. Implicit processes on the other hand, such as the unconscious updating of internal models, supposedly arise slowly but do allow for reliable, persistent changes in the motor system. When adapting reaching movements, implicit components of adaptation have been demonstrated to have an upper boundary in the amount by which they alter future movements, regardless of the size of the experienced perturbation [1]; that is, they are thought to be limited in scope. Here, we allow participants to adapt to small, consistent errors, and when they have done so, introduce further small errors. Consequently, we show that the proposed upper boundary on implicit adaptation can be overcome. We also show that the additional implicit learning observed is not caused by simply gradually increasing the perturbation to prevent explicit strategies. This suggests that while additional implicit adaptation is difficult to achieve during tasks with large, salient errors, and in tasks with slowly introduced errors, it may be achievable by evoking multiple distinct error correction steps.
