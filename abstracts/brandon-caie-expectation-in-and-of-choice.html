        <h1>Expectation, In and Of Choice</h1><h2>Brandon Caie</h2><h3>Brandon Caie, Queen's University; Paul Schrater, University of Minnesota, Aarlenne Khan, Universite de Montreal; Gunnar Blohm, Queen's University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Expectations guide choice. Scientists repeat the sensory conditions in which a choice is made so as to statistically sample an underlying expectation. The statistics of a process can be deduced in this manner if it is ergodic, that is if a collection of samples at one time captures the dynamics of the process at all times. Popular models of choice treat expectation as ergodic within a trial, subject to change between trials. We analyzed the temporal dynamics of expectation in a free choice saccade task, and found that expectations evolved within as well as between trials. We embedded reinforcement learning into an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to model expectation as a continuous dynamic. The OU process reaches a steady-state at a predicted time of choice, rather than at true sensory onset, accounting for empirical history effects in anticipatory behaviour. The model suggests that expectations should be understood as a predictive dynamic interacting with an environment, rather than a stationary parameter locked to choice onset. We provide normative arguments for the cost and benefit of different reinforcement strategies in this model. </p>
