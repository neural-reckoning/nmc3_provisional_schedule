        <h1>Development of cortical projections to the brainstem vs. cervical spinal cord</h1><h2>Julia Kaiser</h2><h3>Payal Patel; Jimena Perez-Tetuan; Nirupama Angira; Vibhu Sahni</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>For skilled motor control, corticospinal neurons (CSN) must make precise connections with segmentally appropriate targets – from rostral targets in the brainstem and cervical spinal cord for forelimb control, to caudal targets in thoracic and lumbar cord for trunk and hindlimb control. However, mechanisms controlling CSN axon targeting to specific spinal segments remained largely unknown. Previous work in the Sahni lab identified that CSN axons exhibit striking axon extension specificity at the transition between cervical and thoracic spinal segments. Crim1+ CSN axons extend past this transition zone into the thoracic and lumbar spinal cord, i.e. Crim1 expression prospectively delineates thoraco-lumbar projecting CSN (CSNTL). We hypothesized that there are likely additional transition zones that function in establishing segmentally specific CSN connectivity. We have investigated the early projection targeting specificity at one such transition zone – between the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. Indeed, we find that the majority of CSN axons (60-80%) do not extend further than the brainstem early in development (P0), establishing them as brainstem-projecting CSN (CSNB). A subset of these CSNB can be molecularly identified by the expression of Kelch Like 14 (Klhl14) a member of the BTB-Kelch superfamily of proteins. In future experiments, we will test whether Klhl14 is necessary and sufficient to limit CSN axon extension to the brainstem by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. Transcriptional profiling of CSNB at this likely critical, early developmental step will also likely enable identification of additional genes that potentially control CSN axonal targeting to the brainstem. </p>
