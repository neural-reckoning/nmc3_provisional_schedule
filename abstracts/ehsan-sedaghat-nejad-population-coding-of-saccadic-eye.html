        <h1>Population coding of saccadic eye movements by Purkinje cells of the marmoset cerebellum</h1><h2>Ehsan Sedaghat-Nejad</h2><h3>Paul Hage, Jay Pi, Reza Shadmehr</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>To move accurately, the brain relies on the cerebellum to build internal models that predict the consequences of motor commands. A major difficulty has been to understand the language with which the cerebellum encodes internal models. For example, while damage to the cerebellum impairs the timing of commands that control saccadic eye movements, resulting in dysmetria, activities of individual Purkinje cells (P-cells) have no obvious relationship with the ongoing movement: P-cell activity during saccades are often modulated much longer than movement duration. However, anatomy of the cerebellum suggests that P-cells organize in small groups, together projecting onto a single output nucleus neuron. This anatomy implies that the fundamental computational unit of the cerebellum is not a single P-cell, but a population of P-cells. The critical problem is to identify the membership of each population. We recently hypothesized that P-cells that belong to a single population may be identified by a critical feature: they receive a common error signal from the inferior olive [1,2]. Thus, P-cells that belong to a single population may share the same complex spike tuning. Our earlier work in macaques had found evidence for this conjecture. Here, we tested the generality of this conjecture across primates by recording from the marmoset cerebellum. <br/>We trained two monkeys [3] to perform visually guided saccades (Fig. 1). To induce errors, we moved the target during the saccade, thus producing a visual prediction error at the offset of a saccade. We used multi-contact electrodes to simultaneously isolate multiple P-cells within and across various lobules of the vermis, finding strong saccade related activity in lobules VIIa and VIIb. We recorded from 110 well-isolated P-cells from two marmosets (65 P-cells from monkey M, 45 P-cells from monkey R), as identified via their simple and complex spikes (Fig. 2). Each P-cell recording included an average of 485±300 (mean±std) correct trials (53,000 total trials). On average, P-cells had simple spike (SS) firing rate of 62.5±17.5 Hz and complex spike (CS) firing rate of 0.85±0.18 Hz (mean±std). We observed that upon presentation of a visual stimulus, the P-cells produced a CS with a probability that depended on the direction of the visual stimulus with respect to the fovea (Fig. 3). That is, each P-cell had a complex spike tuning with respect to stimulus direction. As the saccade took place, we moved the primary target to a random location (Fig. 1B). This induced an error, encouraging the monkey to produce a secondary saccade. The P-cells produced a CS in response to this visual error, and the tuning of CS in the period before the corrective saccade was similar to the tuning with respect to the primary saccade (Fig. 3B). Thus, P-cells in the oculomotor vermis each had preference for a specific visual error (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the SS of individual P-cells were quite diverse: pausing in some directions, bursting in some directions, and a mixture of the two in other directions (Fig. 2B). Critically, SS modulation often outlasted the saccade by about 100ms. Remarkably, when P-cells were organized into a population based on their CS tuning (CS-on), the resulting population response precisely predicted the duration of the saccade (Fig. 4). For example, when the saccade was toward the CS+180 direction, the population response exhibited activity that resembled acceleration of the eyes. <br/>	In summary, our results demonstrate that across two species of primates, population coding in the cerebellum may be via a collection of P-cells that share the same preference for error. When P-cells that share the same CS tuning are organized into a population, their combined SS response predicts motion of the eye.</p>
