        <h1>Effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on long-term potentiation and rhythmic activity in the dentate gyrus. </h1><h2>Monica Goncalves-Garcia</h2><h3>Savage DD, Department of Neurosciences - University of New Mexico; Hamilton DA, Department of Psychology - University of New Mexico</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The hippocampus is susceptible to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) that can result in persistent cognitive impairments. Although there have been many investigations, deficits in synaptic plasticity remains poorly understood. Previous studies have identified deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the perforant pathway to dentate gyrus synapses as a robust consequence of PAE. This study sought to investigate how PAE effects LTP in the dentate gyrus and how PAE influences continuous EEG signaling and time-frequency relationships in evoked responses after high-frequency stimulation (HFS). We utilized a rat model of moderate PAE (60 mg/dl peak blood alcohol content). Thirteen urethane-anesthetized adult male rats were implanted with monopolar electrodes in the dorsal dentate gyrus and in the entorhinal cortical perforant pathway. Evoked responses were recorded (1/30s) at 20KHz and continuous data were obtained at 1KHz throughout sessions. Synaptic potentiation was induced by 5 trains of HFS over 25ms with 30s inter-train intervals. PAE rats displayed reduced LTP of the fEPSP (p = 0.01). Data were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation (FFT) within the delta to gamma frequency bands, as well individual frequencies ranging from 1-16 Hz, including slow oscillatory activity (<1Hz) and rhythmic slow activity (3-15Hz). At baseline, the PAE group displayed a trend toward increased delta power (p = 0.055) and significantly increased 2-3Hz power (p = 0.042). There were no group differences following HFS or in relative power for any phase. Time frequency analyses performed on individual evoked responses revealed a greater increase in power associated with the fEPSP in SAC rats, whereas PAE displayed increased power in later portions of the evoked response that reflect feedback signaling from local interneurons. These observations suggest that deficits in LTP following PAE may be related to alterations in local inhibitory interneuron activity and rhythmic activity in the dentate gyrus.</p>
