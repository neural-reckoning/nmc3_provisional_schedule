        <h1>Behavioral and neural bases of tactile shape discrimination learning in head-fixed mice</h1><h2>Jinho Kim</h2><h3>Jonathan Andrew Cheung; Andrew Erskine; Samuel Andrew Hires</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Tactile three-dimensional shape recognition requires perception of object surface angles. We investigated how object surface angles are represented in the brain, how this representation is constructed from sensory inputs, and how it reorganizes across learning. Head-fixed mice learned to discriminate object angles by active exploration with one whisker. Calcium imaging of excitatory neurons in layers 2-4 of barrel cortex revealed maps of object-angle tuning before and after learning. Three-dimensional whisker tracking demonstrated that the sensory input components that best discriminate object angle (vertical bending and slide distance) also have the greatest influence on object-angle tuning of individual neurons. Despite high turnover in active ensemble membership across learning, both the population distribution of object-angle tuning preferences and individual preferences remained stable. Motor behavior and sensory inputs were not changed across learning, but population response from object-angle-tuned neurons better discriminated object angle after learning. These results show how discrimination training enhances stimulus selectivity in primary somatosensory cortex while maintaining perceptual stability.</p>
