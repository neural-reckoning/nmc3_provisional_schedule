        <h1>Bilateral stimulus-locked responses in upper-limb muscles during visually-guided reaches</h1><h2>Sarah Kearsley (She/Her)</h2><h3>Aaron Cecela, Western University; Brian Corneil, Western University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In dynamic environments, humans often perform visually-guided actions at very short latencies. During a reach to a novel visual stimulus, the fast visuomotor system mediates the first wave of muscle recruitment. The stimulus-locked response (SLR) is a transient burst of muscle recruitment occurring approximately 100 ms after the appearance of a novel visual stimulus requiring an immediate reach. The SLR has been demonstrated in the upper-limb muscle of the reaching arm and is hypothesized to be mediated by the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract. While a growing body of literature suggests involvement of the superior colliculus in SLR generation, the contribution of the reticulo-spinal tract has not yet been investigated. Previous research has shown that the reticulo-spinal tract projects bilaterally to upper-limb muscles, thus we predict the SLR will be present bilaterally regardless of which arm completes the reach. In the current study, participants (n = 15) completed a modified emerging target paradigm, they were instructed to use either arm to quickly intercept a moving target as it emerged from behind an occluder in one of seven possible locations. Surface electromyography was used to record activity from the pectoralis major, an upper-limb muscle involved in reaching, bilaterally as participants performed the task. A psychometric function generated based on arm choice demonstrated that participants typically chose to reach with the arm closest to the target and identified the target location with approximately 50% of reaches from each hand. Within muscle comparisons at this location revealed robust SLRs regardless of whether the ipsilateral or contralateral arm was chosen. Further, between muscles, the SLR was found bilaterally. Our results are consistent with SLR transmission via the reticulo-spinal tract. </p>
