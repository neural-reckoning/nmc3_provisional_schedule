        <h1>Flexible operation of serial dependence in perceptual decision-making </h1><h2>Huihui Zhang</h2><h3>Xing Tian, Division of Arts and Sciences, New York University Shanghai, NYU-ECNU Institute of Brain and Cognitive Science, New York University Shanghai, Shanghai, PRC; David Alais, The University of Sydney, School of Psychology, NSW 2006, Australia</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Perceptual decision-making can be biased towards recent choices. In many cases, the recent past information stored in working memory is structured (e.g., a continuous attribute with a categorical behavioral-relevant choice). How exactly these information affects the dynamic decision process still remains unclear. We examined this ?attractive? serial dependence using a categorization task with auditory stimuli that vary along two attribute dimensions: gender (male to female, 5 levels) and syllable (?ba? to ?da?, 5 levels). We found that categorization of both gender and syllable exhibited a positive serial dependence on previous choices. However, the underlying dynamic process differed between the attributes. For gender, the amplitude of serial dependence was modulated by the similarity between previous and current stimuli, with participants more likely to follow their previous choice if the previous and current sounds were similar (and they responded more quickly in this case). For syllable, the dependence on previous choice did not depend on similarity between successive stimuli. With the drift-diffusion model, we further showed that in gender categorization, the past history (percept and choice) influenced the evidence accumulation, but in syllable categorization, the past choice mainly biased the starting point of accumulation. Next, participants were asked to rate how much the stimulus sounded male/female and ?ba?/?da?. We found that ratings of gender varied continuously along the male/female dimension but ratings of ?ba?/?da? showed a bimodal distribution. Our results suggest that during the categorization task, the continuous percept and categorical choice of gender are possibly both stored in working memory, but for syllable, perception is same as decision, both categorical. The different structures of recent past information may result in the different operations of serial dependence in perceptual decision-making.</p>
