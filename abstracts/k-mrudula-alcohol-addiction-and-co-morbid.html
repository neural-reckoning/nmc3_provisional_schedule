        <h1>Alcohol addiction and Co-Morbid Adult Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder their correlation with Cardiac, Autonomic and Cognitive behavioral Response</h1><h2>K Mrudula</h2><h3>Mrudula, Dr. TN Sathyaprabha, Dr. Kaviraja Udupa, Dr. Arun Kandasamy,  Dr. Jamuna Rajeshwaran</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background and Rationale: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood 
neurodevelopmental disorder which has a relation with development of substance use disorders in 
adulthood. Physiological link and cognitive correlations between the two disorders may involves the
common network activities of the central autonomic network and frontal cortex. Hence there is a 
need for further research on the correlation between the cardiac, cognitive and behavioral 
parameters. 
Materials and Methods: This is a pilot study which is a part of PhD Study titled “Evaluation of 
Neurobiological correlates in men with co morbid alcohol use disorder and adult ADHD” and here are
preliminary results. 16 Study subjects (males and aged 18-50 years) admitted to deaddiction 
department of NIMHANS were divided into 2 groups with 8 subjects in each group: Alcohol use 
disorder (AUD) with/without comorbid Adult ADHD (AUD+AADHD) and compared with Healthy 
controls from hospital staff and students of NIMHANS. Study groups were subjected to 
Echocardiography, Conventional autonomic function tests, Pupillometry, Go No Go task, stop signal 
task and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms.
Results: AUD and AUD+AADHD groups showed moderate to severe cardiac autonomic dysfunction, 
decreased values in parasympathetic activity, end systolic volume, decreased reaction time implying 
more impulsivity. Increased sample size might provide some hints on the correlation links between 
various neurobiological measures like cardiac Autonomic & Neurobehavioral dysfunction between 
Alcohol addiction & Adult ADHD compared to healthy controls.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the importance of neurobiological measures that exist between 
ADHD and substance use disorders and subsequent need of comprehensive study-based diagnosis for 
improvement of their quality of life.
Keywords: ADHD, Alcohol, TMS, stop signal task, Go No Go task, Heart rate variability, Autonomic 
functions. 
Ethics statement: The experimental protocols were approved by the institutional human ethics 
committee, NIMHANS, Bengaluru.

conducting my research.
