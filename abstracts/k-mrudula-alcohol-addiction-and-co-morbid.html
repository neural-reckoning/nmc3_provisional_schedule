        <h1>Alcohol addiction and Co-Morbid Adult Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder their correlation with Cardiac, Autonomic and Cognitive behavioral Response</h1><h2>K Mrudula</h2><h3>Mrudula, Dr. TN Sathyaprabha, Dr. Kaviraja Udupa, Dr. Arun Kandasamy,  Dr. Jamuna Rajeshwaran</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background and Rationale: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood <br/>neurodevelopmental disorder which has a relation with development of substance use disorders in <br/>adulthood. Physiological link and cognitive correlations between the two disorders may involves the<br/>common network activities of the central autonomic network and frontal cortex. Hence there is a <br/>need for further research on the correlation between the cardiac, cognitive and behavioral <br/>parameters. <br/>Materials and Methods: This is a pilot study which is a part of PhD Study titled “Evaluation of <br/>Neurobiological correlates in men with co morbid alcohol use disorder and adult ADHD” and here are<br/>preliminary results. 16 Study subjects (males and aged 18-50 years) admitted to deaddiction <br/>department of NIMHANS were divided into 2 groups with 8 subjects in each group: Alcohol use <br/>disorder (AUD) with/without comorbid Adult ADHD (AUD+AADHD) and compared with Healthy <br/>controls from hospital staff and students of NIMHANS. Study groups were subjected to <br/>Echocardiography, Conventional autonomic function tests, Pupillometry, Go No Go task, stop signal <br/>task and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigms.<br/>Results: AUD and AUD+AADHD groups showed moderate to severe cardiac autonomic dysfunction, <br/>decreased values in parasympathetic activity, end systolic volume, decreased reaction time implying <br/>more impulsivity. Increased sample size might provide some hints on the correlation links between <br/>various neurobiological measures like cardiac Autonomic & Neurobehavioral dysfunction between <br/>Alcohol addiction & Adult ADHD compared to healthy controls.<br/>Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the importance of neurobiological measures that exist between <br/>ADHD and substance use disorders and subsequent need of comprehensive study-based diagnosis for <br/>improvement of their quality of life.<br/>Keywords: ADHD, Alcohol, TMS, stop signal task, Go No Go task, Heart rate variability, Autonomic <br/>functions. <br/>Ethics statement: The experimental protocols were approved by the institutional human ethics <br/>committee, NIMHANS, Bengaluru.<br/>Acknowledgements: I thank NIMHANS institutional fellowship for providing me financial support for <br/>conducting my research.<br/>Conflicts of interest: No</p>
