Transcriptomic contributions to the functional and anatomical parcellation of the human cerebral cortex has become a major interest in systems neuroscience in the last decade. Recent research shows that active transcription of a small set of genes contributes to large-scale gradients and functional hierarchies in the human cerebral cortex (1,2). The combination of our previous findings has shown that different sets of genes contribute to the positioning of cortical areas within functional hierarchies (2) and the organization of functional maps within each cortical area (3). Here, we tested if either set of genes previously identified better explained the recent identification of over 88 cytoarchitectonic areas (4). Using a data-driven approach, we show that the genes previously identified to explain the functional organization of the visual processing hierarchy in human cortex better explains the arealization of these 88 cytoarchitectonic areas than the genes explaining functional maps within each visual area. Importantly, follow-up analyses show that an additional set of genes contribute to the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the human cerebral cortex beyond those genes contributing to the parcellation of the human visual processing hierarchy. These results support a novel hypothesis that there is a nested spatial relationship among transcriptomic, anatomical, and functional parcellations of the human cerebral cortex at the level of maps (mm; areal), gradients and hierarchies (cm; within lobes), and networks (several cm; across lobes). We conclude by showing that a microanatomical substrate supporting this hypothesis across spatial scales is cell density.
