        <h1>Does functional connectivity reflect anatomical connectivity? A simulation study</h1><h2>Patrick  Zhang</h2><h3>Julien Bloch, University of Washington; Eric Shea-Brown, University of Washington; Azadeh Yazdan-Shahmorad, University of Washington</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>        The human brain is a complicated network of 100 billion neurons connected by 100 trillion synapses. Experiments attempting to calculate connectivity typically quantify “functional connectivity,” or large-scale statistical correlations in activity between brain regions. Despite the prevalence of functional connectivity studies in neuroscience, there is no clear understanding of how it relates to anatomical synaptic connectivity. In this work we develop a platform to characterize the relationship between the two forms of connectivity.
	Our platform consists of a large-scale (>100,000 neuron) simulation of virtual neurons with connectivity structure mimicking that of a section of primate cortex. This simulation generates readouts of voltages at surface and intracortical locations, analogous to how local-field potential (LFP) recordings are sampled from the cortex via electrodes. The model corresponds to a section of primate cortex of size 1.5mm x 1.5mm x 2.6mm, which is on the order of recent experiments quantifying functional connectivity between electrodes on a neural implant, such as between Utah array electrodes (Bloch 2019). The model is developed using VERTEX (Tomsett 2015), and the connectivity structure is largely informed by (Binzegger 2004).
        Using our platform we calculate functional connectivity metrics from the recorded LFP signals and compare them to the virtual anatomical connectivity specified by the model. We first compute anatomical connectivity strength between distinct electrode locations. We then compute standard functional connectivity metrics such as coherence and Granger causality from the LFP signals collected from the electrodes, and use correlational analysis to investigate their relationship. 
        Functional connectivity is a contentious topic in neuroscience. Although studies investigating functional connectivity are widespread, its synaptic underpinnings remain mysterious. In this work we develop a computational platform to calculate functional and anatomical connectivity in a biorealistic virtual brain, and characterize their relationship to a degree that until now has been impossible.
