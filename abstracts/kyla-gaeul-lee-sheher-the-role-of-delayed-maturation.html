        <h1>The role of delayed maturation of GABA-A receptor function in schizophrenia</h1><h2>Kyla Gaeul Lee (she/her)</h2><h3>Kyla Gaeul Lee, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University; Raj Rajakumar, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Unlike positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, cognitive abnormalities of this disorder are manifested very early and are present in the prodromal period in preadolescent children. An imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory transmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) unrelated to synaptic pruning may underlie this preadolescent manifestation of cognitive deficits. In the normal brain, GABA binding to GABA-A receptors causes depolarization during early development then becomes hyperpolarizing owing to the changes in KCC2 and NKCC1 expression and function. Interestingly, premature ablation of the subplate (SP) layer of the developing visual cortex resulted in delayed upregulation of KCC2 causing a continued depolarizing effect of GABA in the cerebral cortex. Our laboratory described that neonatal ablation of the SP layer of the PFC in rat results in multiple behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia. In order to study the effects of a delayed GABA functional switch on cognitive function and PFC pathology of schizophrenia, we sought to ablate the SP layer of the developing PFC in postnatal day 1-old rats. Lesioned and sham-operated pups were sacrificed at different time points between P5 and 3 months, and coronal sections through the PFC were processed for immunohistochemical labeling of GAD67, parvalbumin, KCC2, and NKCC1. </p>
