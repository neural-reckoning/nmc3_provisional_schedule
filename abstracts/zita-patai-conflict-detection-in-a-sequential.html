        <h1>Conflict detection in a sequential decision task is associated with increased cortico-subthalamic coherence and prolonged subthalamic oscillatory response in the beta band</h1><h2>Zita Patai</h2><h3>Zita Eva Patai, Tom Foltynie, Patricia Limousin, Harith Akram, Ludvic Zrinzo, Rafal Bogacz*, Vladimir Litvak*</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Making accurate decisions often involves the integration of current and past evidence. Here we examine the neural correlates of conflict and evidence integration during sequential decision making. Patients implanted with deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes and age-matched healthy controls performed an expanded judgement task, in which they were free to choose how many cues to sample. Behaviourally, we found that while patients sampled numerically more cues, they were less able to integrate evidence and showed suboptimal performance. Using recordings of Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and local field potentials (in patients) in subthalamic nucleus (STN), we found that beta oscillations signalled conflict between cues within a sequence. Following cues that differed from previous cues, beta power in the STN and cortex first decreased and then increased. Importantly, the conflict signal in the STN outlasted the cortical one, carrying over to the next cue in the sequence. Furthermore, premotor cortico-subthalamic beta coherence increased during the initial power decrease. These results extend our understanding of cortico-subcortical dynamics of conflict processing, and do so in a context where evidence must be accumulated in discrete steps, much like in real life, leading to a more nuanced picture of conflict monitoring systems in the brain and potential changes due to disease. </p>
