        <h1>Whole-brain imaging of Danionella Translucida with oblique plane microscopy</h1><h2>Maximilian Hoffmann</h2><h3>Maximilian Hoffmann, Einstein Center for Neurosciences, NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, Charité Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany ; Jörg Heninnger,Einstein Center for Neurosciences, NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, Charité Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany; Benjamin Judkewitz,Einstein Center for Neurosciences, NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence, Charité Universitätsmedizin, Berlin, Germany;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Because the fish Danionella translucida remains small and transparent even in adulthood, it is potentially possible to optically interrogate neuronal networks at single-cell resolution across an entire adult brain. However a suitable microscopy technique, which has a field of view encompassing the whole brain and permits to record at least at the speed on the order of the decay time of Calcium indicators, is lacking.
Here we present a novel microscope, which fulfils these criteria. By introducing a new solution for the central re-imaging geometry of oblique plane microscopy we extend the family of these microscopy techniques to larger field of views. We are therefore able to record from a volume of 2600 µm x 1000 µm x 850 µm at 1Hz, while maintaining an optical resolution below the size of a single cell. We use this technique to persistently record neural activity of a neural population distributed throughout the whole brain of Danionella translucida.</p>
