        <h1>A reach trajectory can be learnt using binary reward feedback</h1><h2>Katinka van der Kooij</h2><h3>van Mastrigt, N.M.; Smeets, J.B.J.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Binary reward feedback on movement success is sufficient for learning some simple sensorimotor mappings in a reaching task, but not for some tasks in which multiple kinematic factors contribute to performance. The critical condition for learning in more complex tasks remains unclear. Here, we investigate whether reward-based motor learning is possible in a multi-dimensional trajectory matching task and whether simplifying the task by providing feedback on one factor at a time (‘factorized feedback’) can improve learning. In two experiments, participants performed a trajectory matching task in which learning was measured as a reduction in the error. In Experiment 1, participants matched a straight trajectory slanted in depth. We factorized the task by providing feedback on the slant error, the length error, or on their composite. In Experiment 2, participants matched a curved trajectory, also slanted in depth. In this experiment, we factorized the feedback by providing feedback on the slant error, the curvature error, or on the integral difference between the matched and target trajectory. In both experiments, participants learnt the multidimensional task: they reduced errors in the matched trajectory. There was no evidence that the factorization of feedback improved learning. We conclude that multiple kinematic factors can be learnt in parallel.</p>
