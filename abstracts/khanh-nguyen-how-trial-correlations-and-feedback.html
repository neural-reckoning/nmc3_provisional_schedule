        <h1>How trial correlations and feedback shape sequential decision-making</h1><h2>Khanh Nguyen</h2><h3>Kresimir Josic, University of Houston; Zachary Kilpatrick, University of Colorado Boulder</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>To make the best decisions, organisms must flexibly accumulate information, accounting for what is relevant, and ignoring what is not. However, many decision-making studies focus on sequences of independent trials in which the evidence gathered to make a choice and the resulting actions are irrelevant to future decisions. An important and naturalistic aspect of such experiments is a probabilistic schedule of rewards, in which sometimes correct responses are not rewarded and sometimes incorrect responses are. For example, birds may correctly identify a fruitful tree but have difficulty harvesting the fruit. Normative theory has been developed for such tasks when reward is the sole evidence (e.g., two-armed bandit tasks), but less is known about how an observer should integrate probabilistic rewards that are interspersed with noisy evidence to inform their decisions in correlated trials. To understand decision-making under more natural conditions, we propose and analyze models of ideal observers who accumulate evidence to freely make choices across a sequence of correlated trials and receive uncertain feedback. We extend drift-diffusion models to obtain the normative form of evidence accumulation in a series of trials with the correct choice evolving as a two-state Markov process. We analyze three different feedback cases: no trial-to-trial feedback, probabilistic trial-to-trial feedback, and probabilistic reward as feedback. Ideal observers integrate noisy evidence within a trial until reaching a decision threshold and bias their initial belief depending on the evidence accumulated and feedback received on previous trials. Ideal observers optimize their reward rate across trials by adjusting their sequence of decision thresholds to deliberate longer on early decisions and respond more quickly in later trials. We show how conflicts between feedback and accumulated evidence are resolved, and under which conditions one of them dominates. Our findings are consistent with experimentally observed response trends.</p>
