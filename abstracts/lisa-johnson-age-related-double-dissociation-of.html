        <h1>Age-related double dissociation of fast and slow theta oscillations in children and adolescents</h1><h2>Lisa Johnson</h2><h3>Qin Yin, Wayne State University; Lingfei Tang, Wayne State University; Eishi Asano, Wayne State University; Noa Ofen, Wayne State University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neuronal oscillations are ubiquitous and associated with processes ranging from physiological to cognitive to pathological. These periodic rhythms change considerably during development, making understanding their development fundamental to understanding brain development. However, typical scalp EEG does not access medial brain areas directly and offers low spatial resolution of the lateral areas it does access. Noninvasive EEG therefore offers a limited window into brain development and, as we consider here, the development of cognitive processes such as declarative memory which rely on the medial temporal lobe (MTL) and its connections to specific lateral prefrontal (PFC) areas. To circumvent this issue, we capitalized on a unique opportunity to record EEG directly from the brains of pediatric neurosurgical patients undergoing invasive clinical monitoring for seizure management. <br/><br/>In this study, 21 children and adolescents (5.9-20.5 years) undergoing direct cortical monitoring (i.e., ECoG) attended to visual scenes in preparation for a memory recognition test. We isolated ECoG signals from 80 channels in MTL and 357 channels in PFC. We focused on theta rhythms, which are defined by a frequency of 3-8 Hz and consistently linked to memory processes in the MTL of adults as well as animal models. After disentangling oscillatory components from aperiodic 1/f activity, we detected at faster rhythm ~7 Hz which sped up with age and a slower rhythm ~3 Hz which slowed down with age. These results reveal that: (1) recent findings of fast and slow theta rhythms in the adult MTL extend to children; (2) both rhythms are also evident in PFC; and (3) development is associated with the functional differentiation of theta oscillations. Further analyses show that both theta oscillations support MTL-PFC functional connectivity patterns predictive of subsequent memory formation, suggesting that the functional differentiation of theta oscillations relates to the development of declarative memory.</p>
