        <h1>A Sparse Multiscale Nonlinear Autoregressive Model for Seizure Prediction</h1><h2>Pen-Ning Yu</h2><h3>Dong Song, University of Southern California</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Objectives: Accurate seizure prediction is highly desirable for medical interventions such as responsive electrical stimulation.  We aim to develop a classification model that can predict seizures by identifying preictal states, i.e., the precursor of a seizure, based on multi-channel intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals.
Approach: A two-level sparse multiscale classification model is developed to classify interictal and preictal states from iEEG data.  In the first level, short time-scale linear dynamical features are extracted as autoregressive (AR) model coefficients; Long time-scale linear and nonlinear dynamical features are extracted as Laguerre-Volterra autoregressive (LVAR) model coefficients; Root-mean-square error (RMSE) of model prediction is used as a feature representing model unpredictability.  In the second level, all features are fed into a sparse classifier to discriminate the iEEG data between interictal and preictal states.
Main results: The two-level model can accurately classify seizure states using iEEG data recorded from ten canine and human subjects.  Adding long time-scale and nonlinear features significantly improves model performance compared with the conventional AR modeling approach.  There is a high degree of variability in the types of features contributing to seizure prediction across different subjects.  
Significance: This study suggests that seizure generation may involve distinct linear/nonlinear dynamical processes caused by different underlying neurobiological mechanisms.  It is necessary to build patient-specific classification models with a wide range of dynamical features.
