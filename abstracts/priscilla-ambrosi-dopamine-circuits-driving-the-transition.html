        <h1>Dopamine circuits driving the transition to habit</h1><h2>Priscilla Ambrosi</h2><h3>Priscilla Ambrosi, Northwestern University; Talia N. Lerner, Northwestern University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Habits decrease the burden of decision-making by establishing stimulus-response associations that guide
automatic behavior. While this automaticity can improve task performance, it can also lead to
compulsive behaviors seen in substance abuse and obsessive-compulsive disorder. To understand how
initially reward-driven behaviors develop into reward-independent habits, I am investigating a putative
circuit underlying habit formation in mice. Specifically, I am testing the existence of a circuit long
hypothesized to connect the dorsomedial striatum (DMS; required for reward-driven learning) to the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS; required for habit formation). The hypothesis, built from previous anatomical
data, is that DMS neurons indirectly activate DLS-projecting dopamine cells via inhibition of the
substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). To test this hypothesis, I am using optogenetics coupled with ex
vivo electrophysiology and in vivo fiber photometry. First, I am characterizing the circuit connecting DMS
to DLS-projecting dopamine cells ex vivo using retrograde labeling, viral-mediated gene delivery, transsynaptic
tracing, and intersectional genetics. Second, I am testing whether DMS activation leads to
dopamine release in DLS in vivo. Finally, I will compare the activity and connectivity of DLS-projecting
dopamine neurons before and after habit training. My ex vivo data is the first functional evidence for a
polysynaptic DMS-SNr-SNc-DLS circuit. Surprisingly, however, my in vivo data suggests that DMS
activation alone is not sufficient to increase dopamine release in DLS. My work will not only help answer
a fundamental question in neuroscience – what is the mechanism of habit formation? – but also provide a
foundation for future translational studies.</p>
