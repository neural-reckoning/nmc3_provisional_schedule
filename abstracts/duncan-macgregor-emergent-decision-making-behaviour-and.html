        <h1>Emergent decision-making behaviour and rhythm generation in a computational model of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus</h1><h2>Duncan MacGregor</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neurons of the ventro-medial nucleus (VMN) of the hypothalamus play an essential role in energy homeostasis, possibly implementing decision making between different motivational states. Analysis of spike interval histograms of extracellular recordings of these cells identifies several distinct types based on firing pattern, including varied features such as doublets, long refractory periods, and oscillations in excitability, in particular a distinct 3Hz oscillation. We have been using integrate-and-fire based modelling in an attempt to determine whether these variations are more likely based on varied intrinsic electrophysiological properties, or may be a result of network interactions. Some cell types can be matched by single neuron models. The more complex types appear to require a network. A homogeneous network of random synaptically connected model neurons with long duration hyperpolarising after-potential (HAP), was able to reproduce some of the more complex cell types, including rhythm generating behaviour. Adding a depolarising afterpotential to the neurons, the network could also reproduce bistable behaviour that might underlie decision making mechanisms. However the homogeneous network could not match the oscillatory cells, which do not show the long HAP necessary to generate the rhythm. The solution was to use a network population of two distinct cell types, one with a short HAP and the other with a long HAP. The slow HAP cells synchronise to produce a 3Hz rhythm. This forms a network input signal to the fast HAP cells, producing firing that closely, and consistently, matches recorded oscillatory cells. </p>
