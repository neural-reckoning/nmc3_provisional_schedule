        <h1>Back to Reality: Differences in Learning Strategy in a Simplified Virtual and a Real Throwing Task</h1><h2>Zhaoran Zhang</h2><h3>Zhaoran Zhang, Columbia University; Dagmar Sternad, Northeastern University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Virtual environments have been widely utilized in motor neuroscience and rehabilitation as they afford tight control of sensorimotor conditions and readily afford visual and haptic manipulations. However, typically studies have only examined performance in the virtual testbeds, without asking how performance in the virtual environment compares to behavior in the real world. To test whether performance in the virtual environment is a valid representation of corresponding behavioral features in the real world, this study compared throwing in a virtual set-up with realistic throwing where the task parameters were precisely matched. Even though the virtual task only required a horizontal single-joint arm movement, similar to many simplified movement assays in motor neuroscience and also modeling, throwing accuracy and precision was significantly better in the real task; only after three practice days did success rate and error reach same levels. To gain more insight into the structure of the learning process movement variability was decomposed into deterministic and stochastic contributions. Using the Tolerance-Noise-Covariation decomposition method revealed distinct stages of learning: Tolerance was optimized first in both environments but was higher in the virtual environment, suggesting that more familiarization and exploration is needed in the virtual task. Covariation and noise showed far fewer and only contributions late in practice of the real task, indicating that subjects reached the stage of fine-tuning of deterministic and stochastic aspects of variability only in the real task. These results showed that while the tasks were precisely matched, the simplified movements in the virtual environment required more time to be successful. These findings resonate with the reported problems in transfer of therapeutic benefits from virtual to real environments and alert that the use of virtual environments in research and rehabilitation needs more caution.</p>
