        <h1>Emergence of Non-Linear Mixed Selectivity in Prefrontal Cortex after Training</h1><h2>Wenhao Dang</h2><h3>Russell J.Jaffe, Wake Forest School of Medicine;Xue-Lian Qi, Wake Forest School of Medicine; Christos Constantinidis, Wake Forest School of Medicine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are typically activated by different cognitive tasks, and different context within a task. The selectivity of single neurons for the same stimulus dimension often changes depending on its context, a phenomenon known as nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS).  It has previously been hypothesized that nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS) emerges as a result of training in Working Memory (WM). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining neuronal responses at different PFC areas, before and after monkeys were trained to perform different WM tasks involving visual stimuli location and/or shapes. We found that training induces a modest increase in the proportion of neurons with NMS only for spatial, but not shape feature working memory task, with area 9/46 undergoing the most significant change in NMS cell proportion. Furthermore, we also found that higher working memory task complexity, in the form of requiring to remember location and shape combinations, does not increase the degree of nonlinear mixed selectivity for stimulus shape with other task variables. Lastly, in contrast to previous finding, we saw little evidence that NMS is predictive of task performance. Our results thus provide new insights on the representation of stimuli and task information in neuronal populations in WM.</p>
