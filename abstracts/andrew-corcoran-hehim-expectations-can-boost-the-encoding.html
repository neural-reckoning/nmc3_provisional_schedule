        <h1>Expectations can boost the encoding of specific features of noisy speech</h1><h2>Andrew Corcoran (he/him)</h2><h3>Andrew Corcoran, Monash University; Ricardo Perera, Monash University; Matthieu Koroma, Ecole Normale Supérieure; Sid Kouider, Ecole Normale Supérieure; Jakob Hohwy, Monash University; Thomas Andrillon, Monash University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Expectations about our environment can help us extract meaningful signals from noisy sensory inputs. In some cases, our brain can even replace what is missing, a phenomenon called perceptual filling-in. However, it is still unclear whether perceptual filling-in changes the encoding of information or acts on post-encoding processes.<br/><br/>Here, we investigated auditory perceptual filling-in in 19 participants who listened to two categories of noisy speech: (1) noise vocoded speech (NVS), in which spectral features are replaced by amplitude-modulated band-limited noise, and (2) sine-wave speech (SWS), in which formants are replaced with sinusoids. Both SWS and NVS were created from intelligible speech. Participants were instructed to rate the clarity of NVS and SWS stimuli before and after seeing the original sentence (prior+), a different sentence (prior-), or nothing at all (prior0). High-density EEG was recorded throughout the task.<br/><br/>Displaying the correct (prior+) or incorrect (prior-) sentence induced a state of active listening, characterised by an increase in alpha oscillations. However, only the display of the original sentence (prior+) had a positive effect on clarity (perceptual insight). To investigate how expectations shaped sensory encoding, we used a technique designed to reconstruct auditory features (envelope, spectrogram, phonemes, etc) from the EEG recorded during sound presentation. Stimulus reconstruction was more efficient following the presentation of the correct (prior+) compared to the incorrect sentence (prior-). This increase in stimulus reconstruction was accompanied by a desynchronization within the theta band. These results suggest that perceptual filling-in directly acts on the encoding of auditory information, with the amplification of low-level features of auditory inputs such as the acoustic envelope. </p>
