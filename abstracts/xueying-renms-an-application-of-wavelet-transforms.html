        <h1>An Application of Wavelet Transforms to Identify the Spatial Scale of Multivariate Activity Patterns in Functional MRI data</h1><h2>Xueying Ren(Ms)</h2><h3>Heather Bruett, University of Pittsburgh; Marc N. Coutanche, University of Pittsburgh</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The brain is hierarchically organized across different spatial scales. In occipital cortex, the question of whether visual information is represented at a fine or coarse spatial scale remains debated. Common methods for analyzing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, such as multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques, often neglect the spatial structure of brain activity patterns. Past approaches to investigating spatial scales, such as smoothing, do not allow individual spatial scales to be stringently confined. In this study, we applied a method for quantifying spatial scales –the wavelet transform– that overcomes these limitations. With this technique, we define a set of features that take scale and directionality information into account to represent activity patterns using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (dt-CWT). We classified these features from fMRI data collected as participants viewed four visual categories (faces, places, artifacts, fruits) using the XGBoost algorithm, for each of five spatial scales generated by the wavelets. In occipital cortex, we were able to decode visual categories based on the features generated using the wavelets at coarser but not finer spatial scales. These results suggest visual categories differ more in their spatial organization at lower frequencies in occipital cortex. The categories could not be decoded based on their spatial scales in ventral temporal cortex, suggesting they may be represented at similar spatial scales.</p>
