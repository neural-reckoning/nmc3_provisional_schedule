        <h1>Leveraging postural embedding to identify sub-millisecond organization of behavior in freely-moving macaques</h1><h2>Benjamin Voloh</h2><h3>Benjamin Voloh, University of Minnesota; Benjamin Y. Hayden, University of Minnesota; Jan Zimmermann, University of Minnesota</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Complex behavior is driven by internal states, sensory experiences, and prior learning. Sub-components of behavior are organized by the brain, and are repeated and configured as required. The relative prominence of such sub-components across tasks and individuals provides a unique “behavioral fingerprint”, which can be leveraged to understand the underlying, generating neural circuits. Great progress has been made in decomposing the behavior of model organisms such as rodents, flies, and worms, yet progress for higher-order mammals such as macaques has been limited. This is particularly important, because (1) the behavioral repertoire of lower order animals is more limited, and (2) macaque models of the brain have a greater translational potential for humans. To this end, we hypothesized that during self-motivated behavior, macaques have a unique behavioral fingerprint that allows prediction of the underlying task. We recorded synchronized videos across 62 cameras of freely-moving macaques in a large, unconstrained environment under 3 different task conditions; a foraging task with depleting but predictable rewards, a foraging task with random and unpredictable rewards, and no task at all. From these, we reconstructed 3D poses using OpenMonkeyStudio, a freely available deep-learning software suite we have developed that leverages multi-viewpoint, marker-less image acquisition to reconstruct key body landmarks. Embedding poses across different individuals revealed iconic, sub-millisecond behavioral states. The organization of states exhibited both a local and a global structure; similar states were grouped closely together, and transitions tended to occur between similar states, even though states spanned a much larger space. Importantly, the specific configuration of behaviors – a behavioral fingerprint – was predictive of both the underlying task and individual. Revealing the organization of behavior in a naturalistic environment thus holds great promise for future studies probing the underlying neural substrates that give rise to behavioral differences.</p>
