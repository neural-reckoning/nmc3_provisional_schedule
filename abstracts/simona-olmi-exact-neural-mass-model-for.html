        <h1>Exact neural mass model for synaptic-based working memory</h1><h2>Simona  Olmi</h2><h3>Halgurd Taher,  Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée Research Centre; Alessandro Torcini, Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Modélisation, Université de Cergy-Pontoise; Simona Olmi, Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée Research Centre</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last decade to overcome
several drawbacks related to the persistent spiking paradigm. Memory items are maintained in
the synaptic facilitation and refreshed thanks to Population Bursts (PBs) promoted by synaptic
depression. We have developed a neural mass model based on a recent study on the macroscopic
description of spiking neuronal networks and a well established model for plastic synapses. It is
capable of reproducing exactly the dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks with short-
term synaptic plasticity. This neural mass model gives access not only to the population firing rate,
but also to the mean membrane potential. The latter is correlated to the Local Field Potentials
and to electroencephalographic signals, usually measured during WM tasks to characterize the brain
dynamics. The model is able to mimic several operations required by WM : memory loading, memory
maintenance, competition of memory items and multi-item memory juggling. Memory access and
loading is associated to self-sustained oscillations in the β-γ band and to transient evoked responses
in the δ band, analogous to what is observed in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys during object
recognition tasks. More items can be stored in the WM by considering neural architectures composed
by multiple excitatory populations and a common inhibitory pool. The items can be loaded and
maintained at the same time: they are represented as trains of PBs with the same period, but
delivered at evenly shifted phases. A memory competition is observable already by loading only two
items. Depending on the stimulation features we can observe three different outcomes: maintenance
of the first or second loaded item or their juggling in the memory. As reported in many experiments,
the γ-band power increases with the number of loaded items. The power in the α-β instead shows
a non monotonic behaviour. Finally, we report an expression for the maximal capacity adapted to
the present model and architecture.
