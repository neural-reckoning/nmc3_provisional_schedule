        <h1>Exact neural mass model for synaptic-based working memory</h1><h2>Simona  Olmi</h2><h3>Halgurd Taher,  Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée Research Centre; Alessandro Torcini, Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Modélisation, Université de Cergy-Pontoise; Simona Olmi, Inria Sophia Antipolis Méditerranée Research Centre</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last decade to overcome<br/>several drawbacks related to the persistent spiking paradigm. Memory items are maintained in<br/>the synaptic facilitation and refreshed thanks to Population Bursts (PBs) promoted by synaptic<br/>depression. We have developed a neural mass model based on a recent study on the macroscopic<br/>description of spiking neuronal networks and a well established model for plastic synapses. It is<br/>capable of reproducing exactly the dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks with short-<br/>term synaptic plasticity. This neural mass model gives access not only to the population firing rate,<br/>but also to the mean membrane potential. The latter is correlated to the Local Field Potentials<br/>and to electroencephalographic signals, usually measured during WM tasks to characterize the brain<br/>dynamics. The model is able to mimic several operations required by WM : memory loading, memory<br/>maintenance, competition of memory items and multi-item memory juggling. Memory access and<br/>loading is associated to self-sustained oscillations in the β-γ band and to transient evoked responses<br/>in the δ band, analogous to what is observed in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys during object<br/>recognition tasks. More items can be stored in the WM by considering neural architectures composed<br/>by multiple excitatory populations and a common inhibitory pool. The items can be loaded and<br/>maintained at the same time: they are represented as trains of PBs with the same period, but<br/>delivered at evenly shifted phases. A memory competition is observable already by loading only two<br/>items. Depending on the stimulation features we can observe three different outcomes: maintenance<br/>of the first or second loaded item or their juggling in the memory. As reported in many experiments,<br/>the γ-band power increases with the number of loaded items. The power in the α-β instead shows<br/>a non monotonic behaviour. Finally, we report an expression for the maximal capacity adapted to<br/>the present model and architecture.<br/></p>
