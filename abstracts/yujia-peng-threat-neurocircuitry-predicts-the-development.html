        <h1>Threat Neurocircuitry Predicts the Development of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in a Longitudinal Study</h1><h2>Yujia Peng</h2><h3>Jeffrey D. Knotts, University of California, Los Angeles;  Katherine S. Young, Kingâ€™s College London; Susan Y.

Craske, University of California, Los Angeles</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Dimensional models of anxiety and depression highlight symptom clusters that are thought to reflect disruptions in underlying functional processes. The current study investigates how longitudinal changes of symptom dimensions of anxiety and depression relate to threat neurocircuitry. 

Participants aged 18-19 years (N=269, 183 female) were enrolled to ensure a range of scores on symptom measures related to threat and reward sensitivity. Subjects went through self-report measures of anxiety and depression at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 months. Symptom dimensions of general distress, fear, and anhedonic depression were estimated through a tri-level factorial model for each time point. Linear slopes were extracted for the change of symptom dimensions over time. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans were obtained while participants performed Pavlovian fear acquisition, extinction, and extinction recall tasks at both baseline and 36 months. Neural activity in brain regions related to neural threat circuitry (e.g. amygdala, hippocampus, anterior insula) were extracted. 

Linear mixed models used to estimate relationships between the change of symptom dimensions over time and activation in neural threat circuitry revealed two major findings: (1) Neural threat reactivity during fear acquisition at baseline is positively associated with changes in fear symptoms over and above changes in general distress and anhedonia-apprehension, suggesting that greater sensitivity to fearful stimuli at baseline is associated with a greater increase in fear symptoms during the 3-year prospective period. (2) Neural responses to the extinguished stimulus during extinction recall at 36 months are negatively associated with changes in general distress, suggesting that greater increases in general distress over the 3 years are associated with deficits in extinction at 36 months. These findings show the promise of fMRI fear conditioning paradigms as a tool for classifying individuals into empirically established symptom profiles.
