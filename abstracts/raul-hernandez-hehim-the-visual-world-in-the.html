        <h1>The visual world in the dog brain</h1><h2>Raul Hern√°ndez (He/him)</h2><h3>Laura V. Cuaya; Eduardo Rojas; Eszter Farkas; Attila Andics</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>To create representations of the environment, the visual pathway processes stimulus features in increasingly complex stages, from low-level feature detection to high-level object recognition. In primates, the occipital lobe performs the first feature detection steps, while computations required for object recognition take place in the inferior-temporal cortex, a region characterized for having neurons selective towards particular stimulus categories. In dogs, there is conflicting evidence that nevertheless points towards an organization similar to the one found in primates. Our aim was to describe regions in the dog cortex that process visual stimuli similarly to certain primate brain regions, including both low-level feature detection and high-level category selectivity. We hypothesized similarity between the patterns of activity in the dog occipital cortex and a model of the primary visual cortex (V1 model), and between the patterns of activity in the dog temporo-occipital cortex and a model of semantic organization (Category model).  We acquired functional magnetic resonance images while the participants (13 humans, 10 dogs) observed the videos of cars, cats, dogs, and humans. Using representational similarity analysis, we compared the activity patterns of different regions of the human and dog cortex with the two models (i.e. V1 model and Category model). We found a significant correlation between the V1 model and the patterns of activity of a bilateral cluster involving the left parahippocampal gyrus in dogs and a bilateral cluster involving the right intracalcarine cortex in humans. In turn, the Category model correlated with the patterns of activity of a cluster involving the left suprasylvian gyrus in dogs, and a bilateral cluster involving the lateral occipital complex in humans. The finding of comparable cluster locations in the cortex of the two species suggests a similar functional organization for visual object recognition in the human and the dog brain.</p>
