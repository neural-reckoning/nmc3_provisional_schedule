        <h1>Facilitation of transmission at axonal branch points by nodal GABA receptors: simulations with a reconstructed proprioceptive axon model</h1><h2>Noah Pardell</h2><h3>Jones KE, Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta; Bennett DJ, Neuroscience and Mental Health Institute, University of Alberta</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Large myelinated proprioceptive afferents branch profusely after entering the dorsal spinal cord en route to their postsynaptic targets in the intermediate and ventral lamina of the spinal cord. At each branch point there is a risk that the action potential will fail to propagate (branch point failure). Recent immunolabelling results have found that branch points are near nodes containing both voltage-gated Na+ channels and GABA_A receptors. Historically, GABA receptors on these sensory axons have been associated with presynaptic inhibition mediated by primary afferent depolarization. We used computer simulations of a previously reconstructed axon collateral branching pattern from a cat proprioceptive afferent to answer two questions: 1) how common is branch point failure, and 2) do GABA_A receptors increase the probability of failure? 

The geometry, branching, and myelination pattern of the axon collateral generated large regions of the g_Na/g_K parameter space where action potentials failed to propagate. Branch point failure was a common feature in the absence of GABA_A receptor activation. Coincident activation of GABA_A receptors facilitated transmission of action potentials, rescuing branch point failure rather than exacerbating it. These results are consistent with the emerging idea that transmission along somatosensory axon collaterals in the spinal cord is primed by nodal GABA_A receptors.</p>
