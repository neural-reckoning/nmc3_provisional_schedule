This decline has been related to an NMDAR hypofunction and a reduction of the brain levels of D-serine, the endogenous NMDAR co-agonist. In the present work, we address if D-serine supplementation could prevent the detriment of cognitive flexibility during aging. To answer this, we trained young (6-month-old), middle-aged (18-months-old) and aged male rats (24-month-old) in a reversal-learning task. Middle age and aged rats display a greater number of perseverative errors during the reversal phase in comparison with young rats. However, rats that were chronically supplemented with D-serine (2 months before cognitive flexibility test) showed no differences in cognitive flexibility when compared with young ones. To investigate the brain mechanisms that could account for D-serine cognitive effects, functional connectivity was analyzed using fMRI with a 7T Bruker magnetic resonator. The middle age and aged groups had a significant reduction in the functional connectivity between frontal and retrosplenial cortex, and frontal and cingulate cortex. As well as was observed with behaviour, D-serine supplementation prevented a decrease in functional connectivity making them comparable with young rats. In parallel, neurons from the frontal cortex of middle age and aged rats treated with D-serine had more spines than their counterparts that received vehicle. In conclusion, D-serine prevents a decrease in frontal neuronal spines, functional connectivity as well as cognitive flexibility in middle-aged and aged rats, making them comparable to young rats.</p>
