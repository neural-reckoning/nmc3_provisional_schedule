        <h1>The assessment of visually guided reaching in Alzheimer's Disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment</h1><h2>Alex Mitchell</h2><h3>Alexandra G. Mitchell, University of Edinburgh; Stephanie Rossit, University of East Anglia; Annie Warman, University of East Anglia; Suvankar Pal, University of Edinburgh; Michael Hornberger, University of East Anglia; Robert D. McIntosh, University of Edinburgh</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The onset of cognitive problems associated with Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) has recently been shown to be preceded by functional and structural changes in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The PPC is important for the visual guidance of actions, and focal damage to this region can cause gross spatial errors when reaching to objects in peripheral vision. Individuals with AD, and possibly pre-clinical AD, might therefore be predicted to show impairments of peripheral reaching, but no prior study has examined this. Our aim was to characterise peripheral reaching in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and typical AD, by comparison with age-matched controls (HC). A Peripheral Misreaching Index (PMI) was used to quantify differences in spatial accuracy between peripheral and free (central) reaching. Case-control analyses showed significant peripheral misreaching in a small subset of individuals with AD and MCI, but we found no overall differences between groups. Exploratory analyses revealed that reaching movements were slower and temporally extended in AD and MCI compared to HC, which is consistent with previous findings. Our findings show that, although gross spatial inaccuracy when reaching to peripheral targets is not prominent in AD or MCI, slowed visuomotor processing may be a characteristic feature of prodromal AD.</p>
