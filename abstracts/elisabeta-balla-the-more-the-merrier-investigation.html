In view of highly developed visual systems, i.e., the primate visual system, it has been proposed that due to a divisive gain normalization, more information in a stimulus does not necessarily come with a functional advantage in terms of perception. This study aims to test the validity of this concept in mice in respect to their capability to discriminate between orientations and spatial frequencies with varying bandwidths. In a touchscreen chamber-based 2AFC task, two paradigms test for respectively spatial frequency discrimination performance with varying orientation bandwidths and the effect of different spatial frequency bandwidths on orientation discrimination. There was no clear significant influence of the spatial frequency bandwidth on orientation discrimination, whereas spatial frequency discrimination was significantly influenced by the orientation bandwidth. We can conclude that the proposed gain normalization seems to take place in terms of an orientation discrimination task, but not for a spatial frequency discrimination task. In order to address this question at the level of a large population of individual neurons, we used in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging in virally injected mice (pAAV.Syn.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40), expressing the activity dependent calcium indicator GCamP6f. Orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth enriched stimuli were presented at pseudo-random sequences. Significantly higher qualitative and quantitative responses resulted from the higher orientation bandwidths, whereas the same effect was not observed with the spatial frequency bandwidth increase. </p>
