        <h1>Playing magic tricks to deep neural networks untangles human deception</h1><h2>Regina Zaghi</h2><h3>Miguel Ángel Gea; Jordi Camí; Luis M. Martínez; Alex Gomez-Marin</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Magicians have been in the business of hacking people’s minds for centuries. Some cognitive scientists, mainly those interested in attention and perception, have tried to explain why and how magic works, usually in laboratory conditions and using conventional psychophysical techniques and wisdom. Here we take a step in the opposite direction and ask not what neuroscience can do for magic but what magic can do for neuroscience in order to better understand human cognition. To that end, we studied the sleights of hand of a professional magician in the real world, upon several tricks where coins appear, disappear, multiply, and translocate. Using DeepLabCut, an AI-based pose-estimation system, we measured precisely the motor skills of the magician. We also trained the deep neural network to follow the coins, even when they were not visible. In other words, we transformed a tracking neural network into an artificial spectator. Can we fool it? Given that the neural network was trained by a human, what does it absorb and reflect about our own cognitive biases? The algorithm itself is indifferent to the speed of the magician’s performance and unaffected by change or inattentional blindness. However, just like a human spectator, the machine might still wrongly assume that a coin is in a closed fist, be uncertain, or even get “confused” when discovering it is not there. Overall, we find that the network possesses but also lacks some of the key human brain priors that grant illusionism its effectiveness. Our approach thus shows how it might be possible to use magic techniques to target the development of adversarial cognitive tricks at humans by choosing AI models that match human cognition as closely as possible. We can learn from what machines learn from us, creating a new powerful mirror to look into ourselves. </p>
