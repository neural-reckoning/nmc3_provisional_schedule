        <h1>Influence of dopamine signalling and oxidative metabolism on fluorescent advanced glycation end products formation in Drosophila melanogaster</h1><h2>Ana Filošević Vujnović</h2><h3>Katarina Jović, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom, Emanuel Pištan, High school Andrija Mohorovičić, Rijeka, Croatia, Rozi Andretić Waldowski, Department of Biotechnology, University of Rijeka, Rijeka, Croatia </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Dopamine (DA) is one of the major monoamines in the central nervus system. Disfunction in the DA synthesis, transport or signaling can lead to pathophysiological conditions associated with aging and neurodegeneration. DA influences glucose release, and high levels of free glucose can induce non-enzymatic glycation and covalent bonding of intra- and extra-cellular proteins resulting in the fluorescent Advanced Glycation End products (fAGEs). <br/>Our objectives were to investigate if DA could impact fAGEs formation in vitro, and in vivo. We have adapted a method for in vitro hydrothermal synthesis and semi-quantification of fAGEs. DA and its precursor L-DOPA inhibited fAGEs synthesis in vitro, as did the known plant flavonoid and antioxidant, quercetin (QUE). For in vivo study we used Drosophila melanogaster and have shown that increasing DA pools by feeding flies L-DOPA, or reducing DA pools by feeding 3-iodo tyrosine (3IY) did not influence fAGEs formation. The effect of manipulating DA transport and signalling on fAGEs formation was tested using mutant in dopamine transporter (DAT), fumin, and mutant in dopamine D1-type receptor dumb. Both, fumin and dumb had increased fAGEs formation. To test the influence of extracellular DA on fAGEs we fed wt flies cocaine (COC), a known DAT inhibitor, which increases DA in the synaptic cleft, and methamphetamine (METH) which increases DA efflux. COC and METH both increased fAGEs compared to control flies, and METH feeding led to higher fAGEs amount compared to COC. We hypothesized that oxidative metabolism of free cytosolic DA in METH treated flies could be one of the reasons for increased fAGEs. To test this we fed flies with combination of METH and QUE and have shown reduction in fAGEs.<br/>Results from this study suggest that increase in fAGEs is associated with the impairment of DA transport and its oxidative metabolism. Since detection of fAGEs is easy and non-invasive method that can be performed on skin tissue in humans, our finding supports the use of fAGEs testing in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.  <br/></p>
