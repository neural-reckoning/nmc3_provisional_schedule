        <h1>Sleep does not facilitate human fear memory consolidation</h1><h2>Yuri Pavlov</h2><h3>Yuri G. Pavlov, University of Tuebingen; Boris Kotchoubey, Univesity of Tuebingen</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Introduction<br/>The positive effects of sleep on the consolidation of declarative memories are generally well known. The role of sleep in consolidation of fear memories has not received as much attention. Moreover, only a few studies in humans have used physiological indices of conditioning, and none used central physiological measures. In the current study we investigated how sleep affects (1) consolidation of fear memories on behavioral level and (2) central measures of fear conditioned response by means of EEG.<br/>Methods<br/>In our experiment event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded during a fear conditioning procedure presented twice, before and after sleep or control intervention in 18 healthy young individuals. The procedure involved pairing of a neutral tone (CS+) with a highly unpleasant sound (UCS+). As a control, another neutral tone (CS-) was paired with a neutral (for some subjects slightly pleasant) sound (UCS-). The two sessions of conditioning were separated by approximately 2.5 hours when: on one experimental day subjects watched a silent movie for 2h (wake intervention); on another day the participants had 2h sleep opportunity (sleep intervention). The two days were separated by at least two weeks and counterbalanced in respect to the stimulus mapping. <br/>Results<br/>In EEG differential conditioning manifested itself in the contingent negative variance (CNV)-like slow ERP component. Both period of sleep and wakefulness resulted in increased amplitude of the CNV to CS+ (main effect of contingency F(1,17) = 17.6, p < 0.001) without a significant difference between the type of intervention. The same effect was obtained on the behavioral level, with Valence ratings of CS+ were more negative as compared to CS- (F(1,17) = 14.9, p < 0.001). The intervention (sleep/wake) followed by a block of extinction learning. Relearning of fear after the extinction elicited stronger differential response in CNV (main effect of Time (before-after comparison) F(1,17) = 6.5, p = .02) but not in the behavioral ratings (F(1,17) = 0.66, p = .426).<br/>Conclusions<br/>The data indicate that fear memories are consolidated with the course of time with no beneficial effect of sleep or a period of wakefulness.<br/></p>
