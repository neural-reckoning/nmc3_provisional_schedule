        <h1>Regression-based EEG analysis reveals temporally scaled signals during interval timing</h1><h2>Cameron Hassall (he/him)</h2><h3>Jack Harley, University of Oxford; Nils Kolling, University of Oxford; Laurence Hunt, University of Oxford</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The ability to act and perceive over different timescales is critical in our lives, yet the neural basis of flexible timing remains poorly understood. Recently animal work suggests that flexible timing is achieved via temporal scaling within medial frontal cortex, where a common neuronal response is stretched or compressed across the length of the produced interval. Our goal was to determine whether such scaling could be found non-invasively at the scalp using electroencephalography (EEG). A traditional EEG analysis can only capture fixed-time components because it assumes that neural activity occurs at fixed-time latencies. To capture scaled-time activity, we developed a regression-based approach to unmix fixed-time and scaled-time components within the EEG. After validating the approach using simulated data, we conducted two interval timing experiments. In one task, human participants learned to produce either a short, medium, or long interval. In a second task, they judged the accuracy of a computer-produced interval. In both tasks, we observed a scaled-time component that was distinct from the preceding and following fixed-time components. Interestingly, the earlier in time that the scaled-time component peaked, the faster the participant responded. These results suggest that temporal scaling is a feature of human interval timing and may provide a general method for recovering temporally scaled signals associated with other cognitive processes known to unfold over varying timescales.</p>
