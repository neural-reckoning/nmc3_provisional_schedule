        <h1>Computational principles of motor adaptation</h1><h2>Barbara Feulner</h2><h3>Barbara Feulner, Imperial College London; Matthew G. Perich, Mount Sinai; Lee E. Miller, Northwestern University; Raeed H. Chowdhury, University of Pittsburgh; Juan Álvaro Gallego, Imperial College London; Claudia Clopath, Imperial College London</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Animals, including humans, have a remarkable ability to adapt movements to changing external conditions. Despite advances in understanding motor adaptation at the behavioural level, disentangling the underlying neural mechanisms remains challenging. Dorsal premotor (PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortex are the main cortical areas involved in movement planning and execution, and neural activity changes within these two areas are believed to underlie motor adaptation. However, it remains unknown whether changes in neural activity emerge due to synaptic changes within the motor cortices or through altered inputs to them. As there are currently no experimental methods to directly measure synaptic strength in vivo, answering this question must rely on indirect evidence from neural recordings, obtained through correlation or more sophisticated inference analyses. Yet, the extent to which synaptic changes can be detected with these measures remains unclear. We used a new approach to investigate the role of synaptic changes in PMd and M1 for motor adaptation. Instead of trying to infer weight changes from experimental data, lacking ground truth knowledge, we implemented a recurrent neural network architecture that solved motor adaptation tasks through changing its connectivity. This allowed us to 1) measure task-related connectivity changes, 2) compare ground truth weight changes to the results of common inference methods and 3) compare resulting activity changes to experimental data. Using this approach, we found that two commonly studied motor adaptation paradigms – force-field adaptation and visuo-motor rotation – require only small changes in network activity and underlying connectivity to counteract the perturbations. Furthermore, matching experimental observations, the correlation structure among network units was highly preserved, which is usually interpreted as stable synaptic connectivity. Thus, experimentally observed activity changes in PMd and M1 during motor adaptation could potentially arise from small, but effective, synaptic weight changes in PMd and M1. </p>
