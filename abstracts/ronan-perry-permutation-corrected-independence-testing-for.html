        <h1>Permutation-corrected independence testing for high-dimensional fMRI data</h1><h2>Ronan Perry</h2><h3>Ronan Perry, Johns Hopkins University; Loic Daumail, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center INSERM; Jelle Zorn, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center INSERM; Sebastien Czajko, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center INSERM; Daniel S. Margulies, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Joshua T. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University; Antoine Lutz, Lyon Neuroscience Research Center INSERM</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Making comparisons between populations of brain scans is a difficult task given the high dimensionality of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Distance correlation statistics are well suited to performing 2-sample tests in the high-dimensional setting, which have a wide range of applications including such fMRI data. However, the common assumption of exchangeability among samples, or equivalence of distribution, under the 2-sample null distribution cannot be made if there are multiple subjects each with multiple scans, as is often the case. If naively performed, distance correlation can yield significant p-values solely due to these known, unaccounted for dependencies. We develop a multi-level generalization of distance correlation to k-sample testing which accounts for the presence of known dependencies by restricting the space of possible permutations. We evaluate this method on a novel data set of expert and novice meditators each with fMRI measurements during rest and during two different meditative states. The measurements are taken over cortical vertices and cortical gradients are extracted using diffusion map embeddings. The results show patterns of differentiability between certain pairs of states in certain levels of expertise and avoid false positives that would have been seen without appropriate corrections. The code is publicly available as part of the Python package hyppo.</p>
