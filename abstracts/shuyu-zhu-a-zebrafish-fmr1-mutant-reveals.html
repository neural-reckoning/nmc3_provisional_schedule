        <h1>A zebrafish fmr1 mutant reveals early developmental changes in behavior and sensory coding</h1><h2>Shuyu Zhu</h2><h3>Michael McCullough, The University of Queensland; Zac Pujic, The University of Queensland; Jordan Sibberas, The University of Queensland; Biao Sun, The University of Queensland; Bianca Bucknall, The University of Queensland; Lilach Avitan, The University of Queensland; Geoffrey J Goodhill, The University of Queensland.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), and is caused by a mutation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) gene. Some of the key characteristics of FXS include visual processing abnormalities, visual-motor function deficits and social deficits. However, little is known about the developmental trajectory of FXS, particularly early visual processing and its effect on visually driven behaviours. Utilizing the unique advantages of the zebrafish model system, here we used behavioural recordings of zebrafish hunting events combined with in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging of the optic tectum to assess functional changes between fmr1-/- and fmr1+/- larval zebrafish at 5, 9 and 14 days post-fertilisation (dpf). fmr1-/- fish showed early deficits in natural hunting behaviours, delayed development of neural coding in the optic tectum, and altered development trajectory in tectal network properties. However, these metrics improved in the fmr1/- fish when they were exposed to reduced sensory stimulation during development. We then assessed social behaviour at 28 dpf, and found that fmr1-/- fish displayed increased social preference compared to wild-type fish but slower reactions to conspecific movement. Together these results help reveal how fmr-/- changes the early development of vertebrate brain function, and how manipulating the environment could potentially help reduce these changes.</p>
