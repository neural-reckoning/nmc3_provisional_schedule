        <h1>Is the Kiki-Bouba effect specific to pronounceable words?</h1><h2>Ananya Passi</h2><h3>SP Arun, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>INTRODUCTION. Across cultures, people associate spiky shapes to the word “Kiki” and rounded shapes to the word “Bouba”. What causes this highly systematic shape-sound association? One possibility is that our mouth forms an angular shape while uttering the word “Kiki” and circular shape while saying “Bouba”. Alternatively, objects with sharp edges produce high-pitched (“Kiki”-like) sounds while those with rounded edges produce low-pitched (“Bouba”-like) sounds. Repeated cross-modal experiences could enable learning this association. Here, we investigated the reason behind this effect using a series of behavioral experiments.<br/><br/>METHODS. We conducted four online behavioral experiments using Google Forms. Ten spiky and ten rounded shapes were created. In Experiments 1 & 2, subjects had to associate each shape to a Kiki-like or Bouba-like word. In Experiment 3 & 4, multiple audio clips were played and subjects had to associate them with either a spiky or a rounded shape. The audio clips were either (1) pronounceable Kiki & Bouba words; (2) the same words but reversed in time so that they were no longer pronouncable, but contained the same sound frequencies; (3) pure tones matched to the mean frequency of the Kiki and Bouba words; and (4) Sounds produced by natural objects when struck.<br/><br/>RESULTS. In the shape-validation experiment, 80% of the subjects associated spiky shapes with Kiki-like words and rounded shapes with Bouba-like words. In Experiments 3 & 4, subjects associated Bouba-like words with rounded shapes (~85%), Kiki-like words with spiky shapes(~60%), reversed Bouba words with rounded shapes (~85%), reversed Kiki words with spiky shapes (~55%), metal clanks with spiky shapes (~90%) and pillow hits with rounded shapes (~55%). There was a strong positive correlation between mean frequency of sound and the Kiki-ness of the word.<br/><br/>CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the Kiki-Bouba effect reflects a robust association between shapes and sound frequency irrespective of whether the sounds can be pronounced.</p>
