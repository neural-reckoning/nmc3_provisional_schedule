        <h1>Oscillatory entrainment mechanisms and anticipatory predictive processes in autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</h1><h2>Shlomit Beker</h2><h3>Shlomit Beker; John Foxe, Sophie Molholm</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>ASD is a neurodevelopmental condition that has striking effects on social communication. A less studied family of symptoms that defines it includes rigidity of routine, inflexibility of behavior and an intense desire for sameness. Studies have shown that sensory perception in this population is not flexibility adjusted to changes in the environment, and that their behavior is not influenced by prior knowledge or contextual cues. As of today, little is known about the neuronal substrates that are involved. 
Using EEG on children with ASD, we found that neuronal oscillations are less in-synch with the visual periodic pictures, and show an altered anticipation for them, compared to controls. In a subsequent study on ASD adults, visual / auditory stimuli are presented in rhythmic patterns with different degrees of predictive value. Preliminary results show reduced entrainment to the central stimulation rhythm in the ASD group, in conditions where this rhythm is jittered. 
We propose a neural account for the ASD phenomenology of rigidity and insistence on sameness, which could be crucial to the application of a behavioral training for children with ASD. Moreover, it can open a window for future investigation on the associated cellular and sub-cellular physiological mechanisms involved in it.
