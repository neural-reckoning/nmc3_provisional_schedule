        <h1>BRAIN Initiative Alliance Tools, Tech, Theory, and Trainee Series: Theory (part 3)</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The BRAIN Initiative Alliance (http://www.braininitiative.org/) is hosting a virtual series in collaboration with Neuromatch 3.0 to highlight cutting-edge tools, technology, and theories emerging from the US BRAIN Initiative. The event is divided into three session to focus on 1) Tools (probes, optics, cellular, molecular), 2) Tech (software, hardware), and 3) Theory (modeling, computation),  with trainees integrated in each session. Each session will include five brief talks/demos showcasing new tools, techniques, or theories from US BRAIN Initiative toolmakers followed by a moderated discussion with Q/A.

This is session 3/3, focused on Theory (modeling, computation).

Moderator:
- Elizabeth Buffalo, PhD (University of Washington)

Talks:
- "Human Brain Organoids and Ethics"
Insoo Hyun, PhD (Case Western Reserve University)

- "SpikeForest: web-based spike sorting validation and analysis"
Jeremy Magland, PhD (Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation)

- "The Constrained Network-Based Statistic: A New Level of Inference in Neuroimaging"
Stephanie Noble, PhD (Yale University)

- "Uncovering principles of how cortical regions interact to generate behaviors using dynamical systems modeling"
Sridevi Sarma, PhD (Johns Hopkins University)

- "Towards an auditroy-reliant Brain Computer Interface for effector control in individuals with severe motor impairments"
Daniel Thengone, PhD (Brown University)</p>
