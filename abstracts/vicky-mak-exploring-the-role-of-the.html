        <h1>Exploring the Role of the Endoplasmic Reticulum in Regulating Activity-Driven Intracellular Calcium Signaling in Drosophila Elementary Motion Detection</h1><h2>Vicky Mak</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Intracellular Ca2+ regulates several processes, including synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major neuronal Ca2+ reservoir. Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying ER Ca2+ uptake and release, it is unclear how these dynamics contribute to neuronal activity in vivo. In this work, we investigated the role of the ER in intracellular Ca2+ signaling in Drosophila local motion detection. Cell-types within this circuit exhibit cytosolic Ca2+ response kinetics spanning various timescales. This cell-type-specific temporal filtering is critical for motion detection, but the cellular mechanisms underlying temporal filtering are unknown. Since ER Ca2+ handling can regulate cytosolic Ca2+, we hypothesized that the ER tunes cell-type-specific temporal filtering properties in motion detection. To test this, we measured stimulus-evoked ER and cytosolic Ca2+ signals in neurons in flies using two-photon microscopy. We found, first, that visual stimuli drive different ER Ca2+ signals depending on the cell-type and compartment. For example, within Mi1 neurons, dendrites exhibit slow, sustained (~1s) ER Ca2+ release, and axon terminals exhibit rapid, sustained (~100ms-1s) Ca2+ uptake. Thus, the ER acts as a Ca2+ source or sink during activation over different timescales. Second, we found that RNAi knockdown of ER Ca2+ efflux channel inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) perturbs ER and cytosolic Ca2+ signaling. IP3R knockdown reduces ER Ca2+ uptake in Mi1 axons and Ca2+ release in dendrites, suggesting that homeostatic mechanisms reduce Ca2+ uptake when Ca2+ release is impaired. Finally, we found that reduced ER Ca2+ uptake in Mi1 axon terminals after IP3R knockdown is associated with more sustained cytosolic Ca2+ responses to visual stimuli, suggesting that ER Ca2+ handling regulates temporal filtering properties underlying motion detection. Altogether, we propose that the ER plays a critical role in regulating activity-driven intracellular Ca2+ signals in neurons in vivo, thereby tuning single-cell processing and circuit function. </p>
