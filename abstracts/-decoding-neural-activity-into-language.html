If the neural signal of visual activities is regarded as a special kind of human biological language, it is quite feasible that we can apply the machine translation architecture in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to decode those neural signals. Therefore, a progressive transfer language decoding model was proposed to decode visual fMRI signals into phrases or sentences when natural images were being processed. The results of a similarity analysis showed that human natural language was successfully derived from visual neural activities. Additionally, by comparing the decoding effectivity of different visual areas in space, we found that higher visual areas usually had better performance. At the same time, we found that the contribution curve of visual response patterns in language decoding rose first and then gradually decreased at successively different time points. Our findings proved that the neural representations elicited in the visual cortex when visual scene tasks were being performed already contained semantic information that could be utilized to generate the human natural language. Our study will help in the application of language-based brain-machine interfaces, such as assisting aphasiacs in normal communication with others.</p>
