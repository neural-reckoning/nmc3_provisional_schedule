        <h1>A 3D Parylene-based multi-electrode array for large-scale recordings from the rat hippocampus</h1><h2>Wenxuan Jiang</h2><h3>Xuechun Wang, University of Southern California; Huijing Xu, University of Southern California; Ellis Meng, University of Southern California; Dong Song, University of Southern California</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Large-scale monitoring of resolvable neuronal activities from multiple hippocampal sub-regions of behaving animals provides valuable insights into neurobiological mechanisms underlying learning and memory. However, current state-of-the-art probes such as microwire and silicon electrodes are much stiffer than brain tissue, which largely increases the chance of inflammation, and therefore makes it difficult to consistently record high-quality signals over long period of time. Parylene C is a promising alternative structural and insulation material for building neural probes with reduced mechanical mismatch between tissue and implants. In our previous work, a 64-channel Parylene-based multi-electrode array with 8 shanks was developed and applied to chronic recording of the hippocampus in behaving rats. In our current work, a novel 3D Parylene-based probe consisting of 16 (2x8) shanks with a 250um spacing was developed. Each shank contains 8 platinum electrodes and thereby has a total of 128 electrodes. To aid insertion, dissolvable polyethylene glycol (PEG) brace was employed to temporarily support the flexible probe. The 3D Parylene probe was implanted at 2.6mm posterior to the bregma and 2.4mm lateral to the midline at a depth of 4.4mm. 59 units of neuronal activities were recorded immediately after the implantation. 6 shanks recorded 8 units from CA1 while 9 shanks recorded 51 units from CA3. Histology showed that the shanks were straightly inserted within the 2.5mm depth and began to split after this depth, which was due to the different dissolving rates on the surface of the PEG block. This preliminary result demonstrated the feasibility of implanting 3D flexible polymer probe to deep brain structures for large-scale recordings. In the next step, different insertion methods will be investigated to ensure straight insertion of the probes. The large-scale 3D Parylene probe will be tested both acutely and chronically for recording from multiple hippocampal regions in behaving rats.</p>
