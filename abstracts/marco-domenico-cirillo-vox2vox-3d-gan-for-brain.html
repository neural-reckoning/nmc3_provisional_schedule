        <h1>Vox2Vox: 3D-GAN for Brain Tumour Segmentation</h1><h2>Marco Domenico Cirillo</h2><h3>David Abramian, Department of Biomedical Engineering at Linköping University, Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization at Linköping University; Anders Eklund, Department of Biomedical Engineering at Linköping University, Center for Medical Image Science and Visualization at Linköping University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with different degrees of aggressiveness, variable prognosis and various heterogeneous histological sub-regions, i.e., peritumoral edema, necrotic core, enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core. The treatment depends on the location and size of the tumour(s). Although both these brain tumour types can easily be detected using multi-modal MRI, to extract them using image segmentation is a challenging task. To perform manual segmentation can take 20 - 60 minutes for a single subject, and automatic brain tumor segmentation can save a lot of time for neuro radiologists. Hence, using the data provided by the BraTS Challenge 2020, we propose a 3D volume-to-volume Generative Adversarial Network for segmentation of brain tumours. The model, called Vox2Vox, generates realistic segmentation outputs from multi-channel 3D MR images, detecting the whole, core and enhancing tumor with median values of 93.39\%, 92.50\%, and 87.16\% as dice scores and 2.44mm, 2.23mm, and 1.73mm for Hausdorff distance 95 percentile for the training dataset, and 91.75\%, 88.13\%, and 85.87\% and 3.0mm, 3.74mm, and 2.23mm for the validation dataset, after ensembling 10 Vox2Vox models obtained with a 10-fold cross-validation. We decided to report median metric values because in these way dataset outliers are not taken into consideration, showing in this way a properer model performance on these two datasets.</p>
