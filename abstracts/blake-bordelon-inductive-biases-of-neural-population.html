        <h1>Inductive Biases of Neural Population Codes</h1><h2>Blake Bordelon</h2><h3>Cengiz Pehlevan, Harvard University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The ability to learn a pattern from a small number of examples is a central component of intelligence. Understanding how and why the brain can learn in such a sample efficient manner remains an open problem for neuroscience and artificial intelligence. In this work, we study how the structure of neural population codes influences the number of sampled stimuli required to learn an accurate linear readout. We find that sample efficient learning requires a population level inductive bias determined by the structure of the inner-product kernel, which measures the similarity of neural responses to two different input stimuli. We demonstrate that the eigendecomposition of the kernel provides information about the strength of the inductive bias as well as the compatibility of the population code with certain tasks. In a model of online learning, trial to trial variability (neural noise) can either facilitate or prevent rapid learning depending on the geometry of responses. We apply our theory of generalization to experimental population responses of mouse V1 neurons, showing how they have a good inductive bias for low frequency orientation discrimination tasks but do not possess an appropriate inductive bias to efficiently discriminate semantic categories of objects from linear readout. </p>
