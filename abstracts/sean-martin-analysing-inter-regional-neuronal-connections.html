        <h1>Analysing inter-regional neuronal connections at the single neuron-level</h1><h2>Sean Martin</h2><h3>Shane O'Mara; John Aggleton</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent improvements in in-vivo neuronal recording technologies allow large-scale recordings of individual neurons within and between multiple brain regions simultaneously. Such large-scale recordings potentially allow questions about brain network communication rules between neurons during behavioural tasks to be meaningfully addressed. However, analytic approaches to such datasets are currently lacking. We consider here the expected number of connections that might be recorded between neurons in these brain regions with current technology, to guide what the correct analytic approach to such recordings might be. We consider an ‘inductive’ argument, with multiple neurons in multiple brain regions and a simplified connection mapping between these neurons. Using the hyper-geometric distribution, we derive a probability distribution for the number connections recorded between the neurons of anatomically connected regions. This mathematically derived distribution is validated by Monte Carlo simulations of directed graphs. Our method is applied to simulated graphs with several neurons, based on counts in rat brain regions, and connection matrices from the Blue Brain project’s model of the mouse neocortex connectome. We conclude that the probability of simultaneously recording directly connected pairs of neurons in anatomically connected regions can approach zero, given current recording technology. Approaches summing neuronal activity over larger scales (such as local-field potentials) may offer considerable promise, especially if combined with other approaches (such opto- or chemogenetics), and simultaneously recorded neuronal activity.</p>
