        <h1>Application of Neuroinformatics Pipeline to Gene-environment Interaction in Neurodegenerative Disease</h1><h2>Shauna Overgaard</h2><h3>Shauna Overgaard, University of Minnesota; Gyorgy Simon, University of Minnesota; Laël Gatewood, University of Minnesota; Weihua Guan, University of Minnesota; Prashanthi Vemuri, Mayo Clinic</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Background
The presence of the ϵ4 allele of the Apolipoprotein (APOE4) increases the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is associated with earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease pathology. The theory of cognitive reserve suggests the existence of a resilience mechanism in the face of neuropathology. A mechanistic relation of cognitive reserve to gray matter density has been implicated where damage to the observable brain is found in the absence of cognitive impairment. The aim of this work was to build neuroinformatics tools to understand the complex interplay between APOE4, resilience, and pathologies.
Methods
Objective 1 of this work was to test whether the effect of cognitive reserve on gray matter density differs by APOE4 genotype. The overall capacity for integrative processing may be associated with cognitive reserve; this was evaluated using a core construct from graph theory called global efficiency. Objective 2 of this work was to test whether a higher cognitive reserve is associated with higher global efficiency. The input of APOE4 status may serve different roles and affect the manner in which the system runs. Objective 3 of this work was to test whether APOE4 carriers as compared to non-carriers demonstrate differences in network recruitment, contributions of global efficiency to functioning. The specific neurophysiological mechanisms that facilitate the effective integration of experience and the development of neuroprotective intellectual abilities are unclear. 
Conclusion
The work presented draws on the methodological strengths of health informatics, biostatistics, and neuroscience, to 1) develop a neuroinformatics pipeline for the replicable collection, manipulation, and analysis of data to produce meaningful and verifiable information, and 2) employ this pipeline to evaluate the potential impact of specific allele carriership on what is recognized as a resilience mechanism for the rest of the population. </p>
