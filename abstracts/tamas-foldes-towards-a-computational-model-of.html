        <h1>Towards a computational model of sleep-dependent memory consolidation for associative memories</h1><h2>Tamas Foldes</h2><h3>Yihe Lu, Penny Lewis</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent reviews suggest complex picture underlying the sleep-dependent memory consolidation effect across many associative memory tasks, finding strong task-dependency and variability in study design thus limiting overall generalizability (Lerner & Gluck, 2019). Whilst there are multiple theories proposed to explain sleeps role in forming optimal schemas and there are many computational models related to memory consolidation (Rennó-Costa, da Silva, Blanco, & Ribeiro, 2019) there appears to be a gap between the two approaches in their target areas of interest and explanatory scope; most models being too complex or too abstract to guide human sleep and memory research. In addition, there is a lack of testable computational accounts addressing sleeps role in forming predictive codes (Hinton et al, 1995; Hobson & Friston, 2012) in behaviourally well studied tasks.

We propose an abstract, neurally-plausible connectionist model of sleep-dependent memory processing of hippocampal generalization to show that offline generative replay provides sufficient conditions for the sleep effect to emerge in indirect association tasks (Ketz, Morkonda & O’Reilly, 2013; Kumaran & McClelland, 2012; Ellenbogen, 2007). We argue that autoencoders provide an ideal framework to study retrieval-based inferential mechanism as well as long-term memory generalization related to sleep-dependent memory consolidation and inform a predictive coding account of the sleep effect.</p>
