        <h1>Receptive field geometry shapes information content of the neural code</h1><h2>Alex Kunin</h2><h3>Vladimir Itskov</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A phenomenon observed in many neural populations, notably vertebrate retina, is the significance of weak pairwise correlations in shaping the collective behavior of the population. Models matching these second-order correlations but assuming no higher-order interactions successfully describe the distribution of population states and capture most of the information content of the neural code. We demonstrate that this phenomenon may largely be a consequence of receptive field geometry in the retina, and may extend to other populations of neurons which encode low-dimensional geometric information, such as place cells.

We show these maximum-entropy models accurately capture the information-theoretic content of the activity of mouse retinal ganglion cells. Moreover, such models successfully describe a population of model neurons with identical receptive fields, driven purely by feed-forward input. In contrast, cells with spatially-scrambled receptive fields retain the same pattern of pairwise correlations, but second-order models capture only a small fraction of the information content of the resulting code, suggesting the specific geometric structure of receptive fields plays a part. We explain these phenomena using the mathematical theory of convex geometry, notably a result known as Helly's theorem.</p>
