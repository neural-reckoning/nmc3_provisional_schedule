        <h1>Mentation rate during resting state fMRI and trait depressive rumination: Is there a difference between depressed and never-depressed individuals? (A CAN-BIND-4 Analysis)</h1><h2>Scott Squires</h2><h3>Julie Tseng, Queen's University; Mojdeh Zamayadi, Baycrest Health Sciences Centre; Stefanie Hassel, University of Calgary; Stephen Strother, Baycrest Health Sciences Centre; Glenda MacQueen, University of Calgary; Sidney Kennedy, St. Michael's Hospital; Roumen Milev, Queen's University; Kate Harkness, Queen's University; Jordan Poppenk, Queen's University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Trait depressive rumination (DR) is the tendency to dwell on the causes, meanings, and consequences of distressing feelings, and is a major risk factor for depressive and other psychiatric disorders. DR is usually assessed with the Response Styles Questionnaire, which has two subscales: Brooding measures the tendency to passively compare one's situation with an unachieved standard, while Reflection measures the tendency to engage in cognitive problem solving to alleviate feelings of distress. A conceptually related construct to DR is mentation rate (MR), or the number of discrete thoughts that one has over time. Little is known about how DR is represented in resting state brain activity measured via functional MRI (RS-fMRI) or if people who frequently ruminate also tend to have a higher MR or lower MR. In this analysis, a novel fMRI processing technique was used to objectively assess individuals’ MR based on the rate of simultaneous whole-brain network activity transitions (Tseng & Poppenk, 2020). This technique was useful for studying DR because it prevented metacognition about one’s DR from biasing the assessment of MR (e.g. via self-report).<br/><br/>Archival RSQ and RS-fMRI data from 88 depressed and 63 never-depressed adults, collected as part of the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network for Depression: Stress and Reward in Anhedonia (CAN-BIND-4: SARA) study, were used to assess DR and network transition rate (TR; a metric of MR), respectively. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the RSQ-TR association, controlling for age and sex: Brooding, but not Reflection, was associated with a slower resting TR, independent of depression status. This evidence suggests that individuals who report a greater tendency to brood in response to negative feelings also have a smaller number of discrete thoughts during rest, which may provide some explanation for why brooding thoughts tend to be characterized by repetitive thinking and dwelling.</p>
