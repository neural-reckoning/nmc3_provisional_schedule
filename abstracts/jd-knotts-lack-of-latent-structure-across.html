Following the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, we sought to derive constructs assessing positive and negative valence domains that are observable in multiple levels of measurement, including self-report, behavioral, physiological, and neural circuit data..

Individuals with clinically impairing mood and anxiety symptoms were recruited largely from primary care clinics (N = 228). Participants completed comprehensive assessments from various domains to measure positive and negative valence processing. Behavioral assessments included emotional reactivity and distress tolerance tasks, during which skin conductance and heart rate were measured. Neuroimaging assessments included fear conditioning and the monetary incentive delay task. Symptomatic assessments included 16 questionnaires assessing various aspects of mood and anxiety symptoms and traits reflecting the negative and positive valence systems.

Group factor analysis (GFA) identified 15 latent variables explaining 26.6% of the variance across all tasks, none of which loaded across levels of measurement or tasks. Instead, variance was best explained by individual latent variables for each unit of analysis within each task. Further analyses suggest that some latent GFA variables are unrelated to the positive and negative valence systems.

The lack of latent structure across levels of measurement and tasks suggests that positive and negative valence processes operate relatively independently across self-report, behavioral, physiological, and neural circuits in clinical populations. While these findings suggest that dimensional approaches work well to reveal within-task features, they do not support the RDoC notion that cross-modality dimensions align in a way that illuminates psychopathology.</p>
