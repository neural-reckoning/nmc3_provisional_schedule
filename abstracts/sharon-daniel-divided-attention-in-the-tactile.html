        <h1>Divided attention in the tactile modality</h1><h2>Sharon Daniel</h2><h3>Thomas Andrillon ; Naotsugu Tsuchiya ;  Jeroen J. A. van Boxtel;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Most of our knowledge about the interplay between attention and consciousness comes from the<br/>visual domain, which suggests that some stimuli can be consciously perceived in the near absence of<br/>top-down attention, while other stimuli cannot. Here, we investigated whether tactile conscious<br/>discrimination remains intact in the near absence of attention. We used the well-established dual-task<br/>paradigm from the visual domain, in which participants are instructed to perform a central demanding<br/>task while performing a secondary task in parallel. We compared the performance of a frequency<br/>discrimination task in N=16 participants in three conditions with different attentional requirements but<br/>identical input. Four fingers on one hand and 2 fingers on the other hand were stimulated with<br/>vibrators. In the single-task, participants focused on one finger pair, while in the dual-task condition,<br/>they focused on two finger pairs either on the same hand or across hands. Performance in the<br/>dual-task was worse than in the single task. In contrast to previous visual experiments reported<br/>improved performance when tasks were divided across hemifields compared to within a hemifield, we<br/>did not find comparable result in the tactile modality. Specifically, we found that in the dual-task<br/>conditions, performance was the same for same-hand and across-hands conditions. Our results<br/>suggest that simple haptic tasks, such as frequency discrimination, cannot be performed in the near<br/>absence of attention.</p>
