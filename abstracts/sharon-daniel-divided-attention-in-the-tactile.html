        <h1>Divided attention in the tactile modality</h1><h2>Sharon Daniel</h2><h3>Thomas Andrillon ; Naotsugu Tsuchiya ;  Jeroen J. A. van Boxtel;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Most of our knowledge about the interplay between attention and consciousness comes from the
visual domain, which suggests that some stimuli can be consciously perceived in the near absence of
top-down attention, while other stimuli cannot. Here, we investigated whether tactile conscious
discrimination remains intact in the near absence of attention. We used the well-established dual-task
paradigm from the visual domain, in which participants are instructed to perform a central demanding
task while performing a secondary task in parallel. We compared the performance of a frequency
discrimination task in N=16 participants in three conditions with different attentional requirements but
identical input. Four fingers on one hand and 2 fingers on the other hand were stimulated with
vibrators. In the single-task, participants focused on one finger pair, while in the dual-task condition,
they focused on two finger pairs either on the same hand or across hands. Performance in the
dual-task was worse than in the single task. In contrast to previous visual experiments reported
improved performance when tasks were divided across hemifields compared to within a hemifield, we
did not find comparable result in the tactile modality. Specifically, we found that in the dual-task
conditions, performance was the same for same-hand and across-hands conditions. Our results
suggest that simple haptic tasks, such as frequency discrimination, cannot be performed in the near
absence of attention.</p>
