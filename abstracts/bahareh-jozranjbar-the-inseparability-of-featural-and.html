        <h1>The inseparability of featural and configural visual processing in dyslexia</h1><h2>Bahareh Jozranjbar</h2><h3>Árni Kristjánsson1, Department of Psychology, University of Iceland; Heida Maria Sigurdardottir, Department of Psychology, University of Iceland</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>While dyslexia is typically described as a phonological deficit, recent evidence suggests that ventral stream regions, important for visual categorization and object recognition, are hypoactive in dyslexic readers who might accordingly show visual recognition deficits. But what exactly these visual recognition problems are, is still unknown. If dyslexic readers‘ problems are visual, they could be restricted to visual word processing or they might generalize to other visual categories – all or only some, as face recognition is assumed to require domain-specific mechanisms. There are two different approaches to visual recognition; featural and configural processing. Featural processing is generally assumed to be important for word recognition while configural processing is often considered the hallmark of face processing. By manipulating featural and configural information in faces and houses, we investigated whether dyslexic readers are disadvantaged at recognizing certain object classes or utilizing particular visual processing mechanisms. We recruited 34 dyslexic readers and 34 matched typical readers.  Dyslexic readers found it harder to recognize objects (houses), suggesting that visual problems in dyslexia are not completely domain-specific. Mean accuracy for faces was equivalent in the two groups, compatible with domain-specificity in face processing. However, univariate analyses of accuracy miss that even though no overall group differences were found for featural vs. configural accuracy, this does not mean that the tasks were solved using similar representations or the same underlying mechanisms. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), which originates in systems neuroscience, can provide a fuller description of the structure of information representation in each group. RSA on our behavioral data revealed that featural and configural processes were clearly separable in typical readers, while dyslexic readers appeared to rely on a single process. We speculate that reading deficits in some dyslexic readers reflect their reliance on a single process for object recognition.</p>
