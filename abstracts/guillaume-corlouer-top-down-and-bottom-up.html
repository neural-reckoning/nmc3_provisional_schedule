We address this question by estimating transfer entropy from state-space Granger causality modeling on intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. In an exploratory analysis, we conduct pairwise and groupwise conditional Granger causality on a high-frequency broadband envelope of iEEG signals recorded from 10 epileptic patients. The high-frequency broadband envelope has been shown to be highly correlated with local neural population firing rates, and so is a relevant biomarker of local neural activity. We model information flow between visually responsive populations in three distincts conditions: a resting state condition, a place stimulus presentation and a face stimulus presentation. In each of these conditions we examine the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up information flow between visually responsive neural populations in both higher and lower areas of the occipito-temporal cortical hierarchy. Signals are treated as multivariate, multiple-trial time series, for which we show that state space modeling yields stable models from which Granger causality can be inferred - a difficult challenge given the non-stationarity of the signals involved. From these state-space models, we first infer groupwise conditional Granger causality between visually responsive functional groups of channels, to model information flow between functional regions along the occipito-temporal hierarchy. We then run a pairwise-conditional Granger causality analysis between individual visually responsive channels in these groups, to further explore modes of information transfer in local neural populations between and within visually responsive sites. The aim of this exploratory study is to motivate hypotheses about distinct modes of top-down and bottom-up information flow between face and non-face selective regions of the visual cortex.</p>
