        <h1>P3 component differences between conditions and fluid intelligence effect in 3-stimuli Oddball task</h1><h2>Ingrida Antonova</h2><h3>Patrycja Dzianok, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of Polish Academy of Science; Jakub Wojciechowski, Bioimaging Research Center, World Hearing Center of Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing; Jacek Rogala, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of Polish Academy of Science; Joanna Dreszer, Centre for Modern Interdisciplinary Technologies Nicolaus Copernicus University; Ewa Kublik, Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology of Polish Academy of Science 1</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Oddball task is one of the most popular tasks to study cognitive processing.  <br/>In this study, we aimed to investigate spatio-temporal dynamics of stimulus processing using three-stimuli visual Oddball task. We were interested, if target activates any additional networks / stages of information processing or all steps are the same but differ in temporal dynamics.<br/>We recruited 41 healthy participants and registered high-density 128 active channels EEG. ERP-microstate analysis was applied in order to investigate spatio-temporal dynamics of information processing. <br/>ERP-microstate analysis revealed that both deviant and target stimuli recruited an additional process which was not present in standard condition. This process was represented by later P3-associated microstate with more central positivity. In contrast, the earlier P3-microstate with more parietal positivity was common between three conditions. Although steps of information processing were similar between deviant and target conditions but conditions differed significantly in temporal dynamics of P3-associated later microstate: it had significantly longer duration and higher amplitude for target compared to deviant stimulus.<br/>Moreover, when we divided our participants into three groups based on their fluid intelligence scores: Low, Medium, High, microstate analysis revealed significant group effect. We observed that the group with lowest scores had significantly higher amplitude of earlier P3-microstate compared to groups with higher scores.<br/>To conclude, earlier P3 component represents a common information processing stage for all conditions while the later P3 component represents additional cognitive processes crucial for target discrimination from a distractor. Interestingly, the common P3 component differentiated group of subjects with lowest fluid  intelligence scores from the two groups with higher scores possibly indicating that subjects with lower scores had to apply more effort to perform the task. <br/>[Supported by National Science Centre, Poland, grant UMO-2016/20/W/NZ4/00354]</p>
