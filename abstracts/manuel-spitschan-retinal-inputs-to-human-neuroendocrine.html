        <h1>Retinal inputs to human neuroendocrine and circadian physiology</h1><h2>Manuel Spitschan</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In addition to canonical visual functions, light exposure profoundly affects physiology and behaviour through its effects on circadian, neuroendocrine and neurocognitive functions. This is largely mediated by the melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). However, ipRGCs also receive cone-rod input, making the signal driving the non-visual effects of light complex. Here, I will discuss two lines of my work investigating how the different photoreceptors in the retina impact human neuroendocrine and circadian physiology. First, I will describe a recent study examining the role of S cones in melatonin suppression by evening light, employing the method of silent substitution to generate spectral light stimuli that differ by almost two orders of magnitude in S cone activation with minimal change in the activation of the L and M cones, melanopsin and rods. Second, I will describe a recent field study with congenital achromats, who do not have a functional cone system, examining the regularity of their rest-activity cycles using actimetry, and the melatonin phase angles of circadian entrainment.</p>
