        <h1>Visual mismatch responses are a product of surprise, but not fulfilled expectations</h1><h2>Daniel Feuerriegel</h2><h3>Daniel Feuerriegel, University of Melbourne; Jane Yook, University of Melbourne; Genevieve L. Quek, Radboud University; Hinze Hogendoorn, University of Melbourne; Stefan Bode, University of Melbourne</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>We are constantly forming expectations about our sensory environments. These expectations facilitate our decision-making and allow us to detect unusual events. Accordingly, studies using visual oddball designs have reported enhanced neural responses to surprising, compared to expected, images. Influential predictive processing models posit that these ‘mismatch effects’ arise from both suppression of responses to expected stimuli and enhanced responses to surprising stimuli. Existing studies have confirmed the role of surprise, but have confounded effects of fulfilled expectations with those of stimulus repetition, which mimic hypothesised expectation effects. We isolated and quantified effects of fulfilled expectations and surprise using a novel oddball design based on Fast Periodic Visual Stimulation (FPVS). This design controls for stimulus repetition effects while entraining participants’ expectations toward seeing specific images. We presented stimulation sequences consisting of the same face image presented at a rate of 6 Hz while recording EEG. Every 7th face was replaced by one of two different face identities, here termed the ‘oddball’ stimulus. The probability of a particular face image being the oddball ranged between 10% and 90% across sequences, in steps of 10%, including an ‘expectation neutral’ condition whereby Face A and B were each presented as 50% of oddball stimuli. Oddball-evoked ERPs were more negative between 200-300ms following surprising (10-40% probability) oddballs, compared to expected (60-90%) oddballs. However, expected oddball-evoked ERPs did not differ from neutral (50%) oddballs. Our findings indicate that visual mismatch responses reflect the detection of unusual events, but not the suppression of responses to expected inputs. </p>
