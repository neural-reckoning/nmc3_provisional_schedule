        <h1>Network principles predict motor cortex population activity across movement speeds</h1><h2>Shreya Saxena</h2><h3>Abigail Russo, Princeton University; John Cunningham, Columbia University; Mark Churchland, Columbia University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions, combined with the principle that noise-robust dynamics require low trajectory tangling, yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we recorded motor cortex population activity during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity per se, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity across speeds. Single-neuron responses were better described when regressed against network activity than when regressed against muscle activity. More deeply, population-level neural trajectories were structured differently from muscle trajectories. Neural trajectories had an organization that maintained low trajectory tangling within and across speeds, matching the structure of network solutions.</p>
