        <h1>Extending the Neurodata Without Borders data standard to handle new data types and use cases</h1><h2>Ryan Ly</h2><h3>Ben Dichter, Andrew Tritt, Oliver Ruebel</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) is an award-winning, community-driven data standard that provides neuroscientists with a common format to share, archive, use, and analyze neurophysiology data. NWB supports a wide range of neurophysiology data and metadata, including from intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology and optical physiology experiments. NWB is in use by many labs internationally and is integrated with a growing list of popular software tools and services for data processing, analysis, and management.<br/><br/>NWB already supports a wide variety of data types, but neurophysiology experiments are highly diverse and can require the storage of new data types and additional metadata. In addition, research by its very nature outpaces data standardization, and new data modalities, experimental designs, and tools and services can also require the storage of data not supported by NWB. To support these new and specialized data types, NWB enables the creation and sharing of user-defined extensions to the standard.<br/><br/>As particular extensions gain traction within the community, they may be integrated into the core NWB format for broader use and standardization. We developed a formal, community-driven review process for refining the core format so that NWB can adapt to evolving data needs in neuroscience.<br/><br/>To facilitate the development, use, and review of NWB extensions, we developed the Neurodata Extensions Catalog (NDX Catalog), a novel web archive and associated tools. The NDX Catalog provides a convenient web interface for users to search for, discuss, test, and install NWB extensions. Associated tools enable users to easily create, document, and register new NWB extensions. The NDX Catalog currently has several extensions, which extend NWB to support, for example, hierarchical metadata for intracellular electrophysiology, TTL pulses, cortical surface data, and FRET data. We demonstrate the general framework and workflow for extending NWB and refining the core NWB format.</p>
