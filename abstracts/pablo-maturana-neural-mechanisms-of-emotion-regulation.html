        <h1>Neural mechanisms of emotion regulation: A study with fMRI and dynamic causal modeling</h1><h2>Pablo Maturana </h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>How our brain regulate the emotions during a reapprasial task? To investigate mechanisms involved in this task we have selected a connectivity network consisting of three regions two prefrontal cortex area (vmPFC-dlPFC) and one limbic structures (amygdala). It was studied in two women populations healthy control and obeses. The results describe a neural mechanism for controlling emotion regulation during a task of reappraisal. We conducted Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) analysis, we used this approach to investigate the contribution the prefrontal cortex in the downregulated of the amygdala, finding that vmPFC and dlPFC in healthy control reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images, using the reappraisal task as modulatory factor in each of the connections of our model. DCM was recently supplemented with a hierarchical model over parameters, called the Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB) framework which allows quantify the commonalities and differences across subjects which will allow us to make a comparison between two populations. The findings highlight are role of effective connectivity from vmPFC-dlPFC to amygdala in order to control emotions.</p>
