Electrophysiological data can be obtained in humans but is limited to single afferents and passive stimulation. Here, we present a computational model that simulates neural spiking responses from a full population of mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the sole of the foot. Our work takes into account the unique mechanics of the skin tissue in the foot (including depth and hardness) and includes all afferent classes (both slowly and rapidly adapting) that signal skin indentation, slip, vibration, and stretch. Single-unit recordings of human afferent responses were used for validation and fitting of the model. We find that simulated afferent firing thresholds, as well as supra-threshold firing rates, match their empirical counterparts well. As a proof-of-concept, we then used the model to recreate neural population responses during walking, based on empirical data of the spatiotemporal pressure distribution on the foot sole. The model predicts sharp rises in neural activity during the initial contact phase as well as during lift-off and suggests that these are spatially constrained and differentially activate different receptor types. The model will help understand tactile feedback during gait and can be employed to reconstruct neural activity for use in prosthetic devices through direct neural interfaces with the lower limb nerves.</p>
