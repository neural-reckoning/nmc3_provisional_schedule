        <h1>Representing Fly Behavior with Recurrent Neural Networks</h1><h2>Ishan Saran</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Behavior is a complex process that operates across many time and length
scales, in many different contexts, and differentially to a variety of external
and internal stimuli. The necessity to quantify behavior in a precise and
meaningful manner, however, is growing as the advent of new technologies -
optogenetics, connectomics, optical imaging techniques - in the world of
neuroscience has led to an explosion of assembling and analyzing large swaths
of neural data. Here we investigate recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a
model of the underlying dynamics of Drosophila melanogaster and find the
behavioral representation it constructs similar to representations built from the
previously published results of postural time series. This is a markedly different
result from that of RNNs applied to rat models and we investigate the
implications. </p>
