        <h1>Validation of a Convolutional Neural Network Model for Spike Transformation Using a Generalized Functional Additive Model</h1><h2>Bryan Moore</h2><h3>Dong Song, University of Southern California</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Identification of causal relationships of neural activity is one of the most important problems in neuroscience and neural engineering. Past work has shown that cognitive processes such as memory formation rely on transformations of spatio-temporal patterns of spikes across different neural populations. Such transformations are highly nonlinear dynamical, and cannot be captured by basic linear models. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can capture complex nonlinearity and abstract low-level and high-level features in natural images via the use of deep layers of nonlinear activation functions. It thus holds the promise of modeling complex neural spike transformations underlying cognitive processes.<br/>We treat spatio-temporal patterns of past input spikes as binary images and use a CNN to predict spiking in a single output neuron in a binary classification task. We generate synthetic data using a generalized functional additive model (GFAM) with multiple neurophysiologically inspired functions (kernels) and a probit link function that is passed to a threshold to produce a binary neural time series representing spikes. A sliding window generates binary training images from this time series that are passed to a CNN with multiple layers of convolution with filters convolving over the time domain to capture temporal nonlinearity. The CNN is able to achieve a high correlation between the predicted probability of spiking in the output neuron and the true probability of spiking in the output neuron for the data generated with a generalized functional additive model. The CNN is also able to recover the ground truth kernels used to generate the probability of spiking in the output neuron during synthetic data generation. Based on the CNN's validation via a GFAM, our current work includes validation of our approach with non-linear models using data generated with more complex nonlinear kernels.</p>
