        <h1>SciComm: Panel discussion with neuroscientists in science communication</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Today more than ever we see how critical it is for scientists to communicate clearly with the general public and policymakers. As neuroscience and neurotechnology advances in ways that have increasing impact outside the lab, it is especially important that this community is engaged in science communication either as a vocation or in parallel with their own research. To end a 2-part event, we will host a panel discussion of neuroscientists working in various aspects of science communication. Topics will include panelists experiences in various aspects of science communication, finding opportunities to engage in SciComm, and learning best practices. The panel session will include substantial time for Q&A from the audience, so come prepared with questions!
