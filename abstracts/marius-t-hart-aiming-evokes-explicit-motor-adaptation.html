        <h1>Aiming evokes explicit motor adaptation</h1><h2>Marius 't Hart</h2><h3>Urooj Taqvi, York University; Raphael Q. Gastrock, York University; Jennifer Ruttle, York University; Shanaathanan Modchalingam, York University; Denise Y.P. Henriques York University;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In recent years it has become exceedingly clear that explicit learning plays an important role in motor adaptation. The most used method to measure explicit adaptation is aiming: participants are asked to indicate what angle, relative to the target, they will aim at for their next reach. While useful and straightforward, this method may also reveal the nature of the manipulation to participants, by forcing them to consider reach direction on every trial. This may evoke explicit adaptation where normally there wouldn’t be any. To test this we had three groups of participants adapt to a 30° rotation. These were an instructed group (N=24) who were explained the manipulation and given a strategy to counter it, an aiming group (N=24) who pointed an arrow at where they said they would aim their reach on the next trial (without landmarks or reminder instructions) and a control group (N=24) who neither received instructions nor did aiming. Except for an initial benefit of instructions, each group adapted similarly. In all three groups we measured explicit and implicit contributions at the end of adaptation by asking people to either include (explicit+implicit) or exclude (implicit only) whatever strategy they thought they had. As expected, there was no difference between these two measures in the control group indicating fully implicit adaptation. The two measures differed in the instructed group, indicating partially explicit adaptation. The distribution of differences was uni-modal in these two groups, but in the aiming group, the distribution was bi-modal, with one peak around zero, akin to the control group, and one peak lined up with the peak of the instructed group. This shows that in about one third of participants aiming has the same effect as an instruction, so that aiming not only measures, but also causes explicit adaptation.</p>
