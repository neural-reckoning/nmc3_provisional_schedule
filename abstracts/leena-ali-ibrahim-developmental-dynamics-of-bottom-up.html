        <h1>Developmental dynamics of bottom-up and top-down input integration onto L1 interneurons in the sensory cortex</h1><h2>Leena Ali Ibrahim</h2><h3>Leena A Ibrahim, Harvard Medical School; Shuhan Huang, Harvard Medical School; Marian Fernandez-Otero, Harvard Medical School; , Emilia Favuzzi, Broad Institute; Bernardo Rudy, New York University; Gord Fishell, Harvard Medical School and Broad Institute</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Information processing in a sensory cortex combines ‘bottom-up’ sensory experience, with feedback from higher cortical areas, modulation by subcortical systems, as well as cross-modal modulation by other sensory cortices. These projections jointly create an internal representation used to predict the incoming stimuli and reconcile it with expectation. How such representations emerge during development are not well understood. L1 interneurons (INs) are positioned at the nexus where top-down and bottom-up information converges and thus are likely playing a critical role in this modulation. They receive both strong cortico-cortical inputs from higher cortices, as well as bottom-up thalamic inputs and their inhibitory nature allows them to modulate sensory processing. Retrograde rabies tracing during early postnatal development within primary auditory (A1) and primary visual (V1) cortex, demonstrated that L1 INs receive strong first-order thalamic inputs during early sensory signaling. While these persist into adulthood, they become diminished. We hypothesize that the dominant bottom up input is important for establishing and refining long range top-down inputs (such as from the Anterior Cingulate Cortex, ACA,  Premotor Cortex, M2 and Retrosplenial Cortex, RSP) onto L1 INs. Our in-vitro patch clamp data suggests that L1 interneurons in A1 and V1 receive functional inputs from the first-order thalamus; MGBv and dLGN respectively, and some of those inputs are mirrored in L4.  By simultaneously providing L1 interneurons with both ascending sensory inputs, as well as cortico-cortical feedback inputs, accurate sensory processing and modulation in L2/3 can be established. Through this process the projections from the ACA/M2 which are initially abundant but weak are refined and strengthened. As this occurs precisely during the period when thalamic inputs are decreased, we posit that these two events are functionally coordinated. Additionally, our preliminary data suggests that sensory experience is necessary for the strengthening and refinement of these cortical top down inputs. We thus predict that bottom-up inputs to L1 interneurons during development are important for the establishment of cortico-cortical feedback circuitry. </p>
