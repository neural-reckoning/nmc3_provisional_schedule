        <h1>Optogenetic activation of the inhibitory nigro-collicular pathway evokes paradoxical contralateral orienting movement in mice.</h1><h2>Claudio Villalobos Dintrans</h2><h3>Michelle Basso, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The current model for controlling movement initiation proposes that the basal ganglia (BG) plays a permissive role in the generation of movements through the modulation of the amount of inhibition on BG target structures such as the superior colliculus (SC), a key structure involved in orienting control. One of the outputs of the BG, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), contains GABAergic neurons that primarily project to the ipsilateral SC. The current model suggests that the removal of SNr inhibition, combined with excitatory drive from the cerebral cortex to the SC, produces contralateral orienting movements. This model of action is often referred to as the rate model, where the rate of inhibitory spiking of the SNr onto target structures is what determines the initiation of movement; high rates and inhibition results in no movement, while low rates and less inhibition produces movement. We tested this hypothesis by controlling the rate of SNr activity into the SC using optogenetics. Contrary to the model predictions, optogenetic activation of the SNr terminals into the SC of mice evoked, rather than prevented, contralateral movement. To determine how orienting movements may result from the activation of inhibitory terminals, we performed a series of slice experiments and found that the same optogenetic stimulation that evoked contralateral movements in vivo evoked post-inhibitory rebound depolarization and spiking in the SC output neurons. Only high frequency stimulation evoked contralateral movements in vivo and triggered rebound spiking in vitro. The latency of orienting movements relative to the pulse stimulation in vivo was comparable to the latency of rebound spiking in vitro. These results challenge the current dogma regarding the role of the nigro-collicular pathway in the initiation of orienting movements and may provide new understanding on the progression and pathophysiology of movement disorders associated with the function of the BG.</p>
