        <h1>Modeling of behavioral tasks for data sharing using state machines</h1><h2>Pamela Baker</h2><h3>Pamela Baker, Allen Institute for Brain Science; Lydia Ng, Allen Institute for Brain Science</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Rigorous descriptions of experimental methods are critical for reproducing protocols, comparing different studies, performing data analyses, and building accurate computational models to predict and explain results. Behavioral tasks are a critical component of many neurophysiology studies, but published task descriptions vary greatly in the amount of information they convey about task structure and logic, and this lack of standardization can make task descriptions difficult to interpret and insufficient to reproduce the methods and analyses. 
Our goal is to build a schema for representation of behavioral tasks that is machine-readable and uses existing standards and formats for specification; facilitates comparison of task structure and logic; permits task emulation for testing and debugging of experimental designs; and captures the essential metadata for performing relevant data analyses. This schema will be used to extend the NWB:N data standard (http://www.nwb.org) for storing task descriptions and metadata.
Our approach was to model tasks as finite state machines (FSMs). Many types of tasks can be modeled by FSMs, and many common software packages for designing and executing tasks for neurophysiology studies use an FSM framework. We used MagicDraw, a commercial systems engineering software package that includes a freeware version, to build executable task models. MagicDraw was chosen because it allows for the graphical design of state machines for task logic, enables task emulation with model outputs for later analyses, and uses existing UML standards for building and exporting FSM descriptions. 
We have developed a set of task models in MagicDraw that cover the most common task designs for rodent neurophysiology. We will demo some of these models and present the results of simulations. We will discuss what FSM task models can and canâ€™t capture, and hope to stimulate discussion of essential metadata for behavioral task description and sharing, and to discuss features to include in task representations that would be most useful  for facilitating sharing in the community.
