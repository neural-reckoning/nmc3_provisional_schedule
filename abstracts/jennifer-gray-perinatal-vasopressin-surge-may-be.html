        <h1>Perinatal vasopressin surge may be neuroprotective with implications for neurodevelopment</h1><h2>Jennifer Gray</h2><h3>Yarely C. Hoffiz, Ph.D.; Alexandra Castillo-Ruiz, Ph.D.; Taylor A. Hite; Nancy G. Forger, Ph.D.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>A striking surge in vasopressin (VP) accompanies birth in humans, but the neural underpinnings and function of this surge remain unknown. In the current study, first sought to determine whether there is a similar surge in mice by measuring plasma levels of copeptin (a proxy for VP) following either a vaginal or C-sectioned birth. We found that neonates experience a â‰¥ 50-fold elevation in peripheral copeptin levels compared to adult mice, and that these levels are significantly higher in mice born vaginally compared to those born by C-section. We also found that VP mRNA expression in the hypothalamus significantly increases during the days prior to birth, and that hypothalamic VP neurons are activated at birth based on cFos labeling. Additionally, we observed significantly decreased plasma osmolality at 1 and 3 hours following a vaginal, but not C-section birth, indicating a transient increase in water retention following a vaginal birth. Importantly, our lab has previously shown that neuronal cell death is significantly decreased at 3 hours following a vaginal, but not C-section birth, in several brain regions. We then established a detailed time course of cell death, showing a significant drop in cell death at 3 hours in the PVN, BNSTl, and LS. To test whether perinatal VP release may be neuroprotective, we performed intracerebroventricular injections of VP in C-sectioned mice 3 hours after birth. We observed a significant reduction in cell death in the PVN and AHA in C-sectioned mice that received VP compared to control. Overall, these data suggest that there is a surge in both central and peripheral VP which may be neuroprotective during early brain development. </p>
