        <h1>Individual Differences in Anxious Temperament relate to Differences in Brain Morphometrics</h1><h2>Jessi M.  Kane</h2><h3>Kane, J.M., Schagene, J.D. & Depue, B.E.</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Anxiety disorders constitute the most prevalent subgroup of mental disorders in most western societies, with an estimated lifetime incidence of 33.7% in the US. Anxiety can be defined as a prolonged state of apprehension elicited by unpredictable threats, or threats that are spatially or temporally distant. The current study utilized structural images from three studies (N=75) to examine individual differences in different mood and anxiety socioemotional questionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory, Penn State Worry Questionnaire, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire90, Ruminative Response Scale) and both cortical and subcortical brain metrics using surface-based morphometry. Cortical results indicated that increases in both the STAI and MASQ90 (general anxiety) related to increased grey matter area in the bilateral occipital pole (i.e., pericalcarine cortex, lingual gyrus). While subcortical results indicated that increased bilateral amygdala volume was related to increases in the STAI, MASQ90 (general anxiety) and RRS (rumination). Additionally, increases in bilateral nucleus accumbens volume was related to the positive affect dimension of the MASQ90. Results suggest that individual differences in anxious temperament, as measured by the STAI and MASQ90, may be related to increased visual cortex area, perhaps related to hypervigilance of the environment. Additionally, increased anxious temperament as measured by the STAI, MASQ90 and RRS, appear related to increased volume of the amygdala, again perhaps suggesting, increased threat processing due to hypervigilance. Finally, increased positive affect, as measured by the MASQ90, was related to increased nucleus accumbens volume, possibly indicating the role of dopaminergic ventral-striatal regions in positive mood.  </p>
