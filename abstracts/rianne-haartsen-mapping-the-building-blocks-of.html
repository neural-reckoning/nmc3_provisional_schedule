Difficulties in facial processing and variability in neural processing of faces are common in individuals with autism across development. It remains unknown whether this individual variability in face processing between individuals with and without autism is better explained by qualitative differences in the involvement of different neural processing pathways or by quantitative differences in the neural processing of similar neural pathways.
In this study, we investigated spatial and temporal characteristics of face processing using electroencephalography in children with and without autism (N’s = 53 and 40), adolescents with and without autism (N’s = 79 and 68), and adults with and without autism (N’s = 90 and 74) from the Longitudinal European Autism Project. We applied multi-channel data-driven analyses to the event-related responses to upright and inverted faces (modulating configural face processing) and tested for qualitative differences in scalp topography with topographic analyses of variance and for quantitative differences in strength of these topographies with global field power comparisons. Next, we extracted distinct spatiotemporal microstates to examine neural timings for responses to faces for the different orientations and diagnostic groups. 
The neurotypical groups displayed distinct temporal and topographic profiles with different strengths for the upright and inverted faces. Topography and strength of the scalp profiles showed subtle differences between individuals with and without autism in the adolescents, but not in the children and adults. The microstate approach revealed quantitative differences between diagnostic groups during the early temporal stages of face processing, and qualitative differences between diagnostic groups during the later temporal stages of face processing across all age groups. 
Our findings demonstrate the importance of multi-channel spatiotemporal analytic approaches in investigating neural responses in neurodevelopmental disorders. Alterations emerging at early stages of development in autism may result in compensatory processes later in development.
