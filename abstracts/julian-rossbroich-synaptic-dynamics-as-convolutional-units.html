        <h1>Synaptic Dynamics as Convolutional Units</h1><h2>Julian Rossbroich</h2><h3>Julian Rossbroich, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research; Daniel Trotter, University of Ottawa; Katalin Tóth, University of Ottawa; Richard Naud, University of Ottawa</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Communication in the nervous system is largely based on temporal sequences of action potentials. A central feature of this communication is that the efficacy of action potentials is variable on short (10 ms - 10 s) time scales. These short-term plasticity (STP) dynamics differ markedly across connections and strongly regulate how action potentials are being communicated to postsynaptic partners. <br/><br/>Traditionally, STP dynamics are mathematically described by simple mechanistic models, such as the Tsodyks-Markram model, in which the parameters correspond to biophysical mechanisms. Optimizing the model parameters to best describe experimental data therefore yields an estimate of biophysical properties. However, such traditional models fail to capture the diversity of STP dynamics that are experimentally observed in response to complex stimulation patterns.<br/><br/>Here, we are willing to sacrifice some of the model’s biophysical interpretability in order to phenomenologically describe the large range of experimentally observed dynamics. To this end, we develop a flexible mathematical framework based on a linear-nonlinear operation. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the resulting Spike Response Plasticity (SRP) model is more adaptable than previous models. We show that the model captures short-term facilitation, short-term depression, biphasic plasticity, as well as supralinear facilitation and post-burst potentiation. Additionally, using standard gradient descent algorithms, model parameters can be inferred accurately with limited amount of experimental data.<br/><br/>Our model therefore provides a more flexible alternative to traditional mechanistic STP models. It can be used for large-scale characterization of synaptic dynamics and can easily be implemented in large-scale network models. Finally, our modeling framework makes explicit that synaptic processing bears algorithmic similarities with information processing in convolutional neural networks.</p>
