        <h1>Adult-born Neurons Inhibit Developmentally-born Neurons</h1><h2>Alyssa Ash</h2><h3>Elena Regele-Blasco; Erin Chahley; Desiree Seib; Jason Snyder, UBC</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>     Recent reports indicate that lateral inhibition plays a powerful role in selecting which dentate gyrus (DG) neurons are recruited during memory formation. This raises the question of whether developmentally-born and adult-born DG neurons have distinct roles for inhibition, particularly in vivo when neuronal ensembles are selected during memory encoding. To address this we combined chemogenetics and immunohistochemistry for BrdU+Fos to silence and measure activity in developmentally and adult-born neurons as rats learned a spatial water maze task. Specifically, retrovirus was injected into the DG of male rats at 6 weeks of age to express the inhibitory DREADD receptor, HM4Di, in neurons born in adulthood. The same rats were also injected with BrdU to label developmentally or adult-born neurons. At 10 weeks of age rats were injected with either the HM4Di agonist CNO or vehicle, then trained in the water maze. We found that silencing a subset of adult-born neurons (aged 4 weeks) increased activity levels in the developmentally-born neuron population. However, silencing adult-born neurons did not affect activation in other adult-born neurons within the DG, suggesting limited interaction amongst the adult-born population. As well, we have examined activation of interneurons (PV+ and SST+) within each treatment group to determine if silencing neurons at different ages impacts downstream activity in inhibitory interneurons. Our recent findings implicate PV+ interneurons in the modulatory subcircuit between neuron populations within the DG.<br/></p>
