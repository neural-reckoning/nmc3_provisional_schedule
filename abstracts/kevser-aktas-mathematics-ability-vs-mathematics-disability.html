        <h1>Mathematics Ability vs. Mathematics Disability</h1><h2>Kevser Aktas</h2><h2>Abstract</h1><p>In 1904, Spearman used the term general intelligence “g” as a measurement or success in a various form of cognitive tasks (Spearman, 1961). General intelligence is one of the most heritable behaviour traits, with heritability rising from 40% from childhood to 80% in adulthood (Kropnik et al., 2016).  Mathematics ability(MA) is an important indicator of human intelligence (Chen et al., 2017). Basic arithmetic calculations and related numeracy skills are essential part of the normal brain operation (Docherty et al., 2010). The genetic complexities of MA might explain the fundamentals of general intelligence both at genetic and neurobiological level. On the other hand, American Psychiatric Association (1994) defines mathematics disability(MD) as receiving arithmetic scores at least 2 years below expected grade level. The studies show that 6% of school children face with MD. One of the well-known mathematical disorders as known dyscalculia is an important impairment that may cause severe problems in an individual’s life but with the help of better understanding of neurobiological and genetic aspects of the cases with proper arrangements in environmental factors would help to reduce the effects of the disorder. In the last two decades, rising interest on applications of neuroscience studies increased interventions of the studies in educational context. In this talk, I will present the genetic and neurobiological components of MA and MD as well as introducing Genome Wide Association Studies(GWAS) related to the research field. In addition, I will discuss the environmental factors that effect Mathematics ability and developmental disorders such as dyscalculia. The role of the society with some example of educational policies from the past, today’s applications and connection to genetics and neuroscience research will be explained. Finally, the future of the neuroscientific studies in educational setting will be discussed. </p>
