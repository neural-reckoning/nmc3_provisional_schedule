        <h1>Pluralistic Approach to Decoding Motor Activity from Different Brain Regions</h1><h2>Rishika  Mohanta</h2><h3>Prakriti Nayak, Kingâ€™s College London; Narotam Singh, JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, Mysuru; Vaibhav Sharma, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>There exists a high degree of correlation and redundancy in the activity of neural populations across different regions of the brain; motor function is a result of such activities, coordinated over various regions. This project explored different approaches to decode activity from motor implicated regions in rodents using spike and population activity. The data, sourced from the Steinmetz dataset, was cleaned to consider recordings only from the motor related areas, while focussing on the the open loop condition - data between stimulus onset and go-cue - to avoid representations of stimulus movement. In order to identify whether neuronal spike activity accurately predicted motor function, general linear modelling (GLM) was used to decode the motor output (assumed from the wheel output) from the neural spike data from randomly sampled neurons (50) and trials (100) in different brain regions. This was implemented using cross-validated ridge regression. The length of the temporal kernel, or the spiking history required for optimal decoding, can vary from region to region; therefore, different kernel sizes, between 50ms to 250ms, were evaluated to choose the optimal kernel size for the analyses. Parallely, Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA) was implemented to compute the latent dimensions in the spiking population activity, followed by ridge regression to reconstruct the motor output and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classify directional (left, right, or none) motor output in the lower dimensional space. It was concluded from the results that while spikes from different brain areas roughly predict the motor output to different degrees, the latent neural modes of these regions do not separate the output equally.
