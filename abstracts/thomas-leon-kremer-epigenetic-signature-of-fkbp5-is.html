        <h1>Epigenetic signature of FKBP5 is associated with structural changes in emotion regulatory brain circuits</h1><h2>Thomas Leon Kremer</h2><h3>Thomas Leon Kremer, University Heidelberg; Urs Braun, University Heidelberg; Junfang Chen, University Heidelberg; Anais Harneit, University Heidelberg; Kristina Schwarz, University Heidelberg; Janina I. Schweiger, University Heidelberg; Markus Reichert, University Heidelberg; Emanuel Schwarz, University Heidelberg; Andreas Meyer-Lindenberg, University Heidelberg; Heike Tost, University Heidelberg</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Disturbances in regulatory brain circuits involved in neural stress and emotion processing are commonly observed across many psychiatric disorders. Prominently, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) serve as convergence sites for genetic and environmental risk factors. Epigenetic disinhibition of FKBP5, a regulator of the HPA-axis, might be a biological mechanism that translates environmental influences into altered brain function. Two specific DNA-Methylation (DNAm) loci have recently been identified as being particularly relevant for the epigenetic regulation of FKBP5. Here, we investigate the brain structural correlates of these epigenetic loci. In total 395 (194 women; age:28.12Â±10.45) healthy caucasian subjects underwent structural T1 MRI-Scans. Data was preprocessed using the CAT12 toolbox (in SPM12) following standard procedures. DNAm was assessed using the Illumina EPIC array and residualized for sex, age, cell composition, smoking and the first 10 PCs. The DNAm of the two loci of interest, cg20813374 and cg00130530, were averaged. Two General Linear Models on grey matter volume with (i) FKBP5 DNAm [n=395] and (ii) the trait version of the State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) [n=224] as predictors were build. Region-of-interest (ROI) analyses with ROI comprising  ACC, mPFC, Hippocampus and Amygdala were conducted. FKBP5 DNAm was significantly associated with grey matter volume in the medial Orbitofrontal Cortex (T=4.37, p=.030 Family-wise error (FWE)-corrected in ROI). Within the FKBP5-dependent morphometric changes trait anxiety was negatively associated with perigenual ACC volume (T=-3.61, p=.044 FWE-corrected in ROI). We demonstrate that DNAm of key loci in FKBP5 and established risk markers for affective disorders converge on the same regions within a well-known brain circuits underlying neural stress processing, highlighting the importance of brain circuits in translating epigenetic into psychological risk.</p>
