        <h1>Ventral Tegmental Area projecting dopaminergic neurons, as a neural substrate for flexible adaptation of goal directed behaviors</h1><h2>Javier VÃ¡zquez</h2><h3>Pierre Trifilieff, University of Bordeaux; Andrea Contini, University of Bordeaux</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Several psychiatric conditions such as drug addiction or schizophrenia are marked by an impairment in the ability to optimally acquire and/or express goal-directed actions. Such alterations in executive control have been associated with a dysfunction of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), possibly linked to an alteration of dopamine (DA) transmission. However, preclinical data regarding the implication of DA signalling in executive control remain controversial. Here, we used a chemogenetic approach to selectively and reversibly inhibit DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and assess the effect on distinct components of goal-directed behavior using the outcome devaluation task that allows assessing the ability of animals to flexibly adapt goal-directed actions. <br/>We found that while inhibition of VTA-DA neurons during outcome devaluation had no effect, the same manipulation during reversal of the instrumental contingencies resulted in a deficit in a subsequent outcome devaluation test. Our data provide clear evidence regarding the implication of VTA-DA transmission in the capacity to flexibly adapt goal-directed behaviors. These findings support the idea that alteration of VTA-DA transmission could participate to the aetiology of cognitive symptoms in psychiatric disorders.<br/></p>
