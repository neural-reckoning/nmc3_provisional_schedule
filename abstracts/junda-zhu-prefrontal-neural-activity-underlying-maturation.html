        <h1>Prefrontal neural activity underlying maturation of antisaccade task performance  </h1><h2>Junda Zhu</h2><h3>Junda Zhu, Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine; Xin Zhou, Department of Computer Science, Stanford University; Terrence R. Stanford, Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine; Emilio Salinas, Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine; Christos Constantinidis, Department of Neurobiology & Anatomy, Wake Forest School of Medicine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Executive function, including the ability to resist prepotent responses and plan appropriate actions matures relatively late in life, after adolescence. The antisaccade task is often used to evaluate response inhibition during development and adults are able to perform not only fewer incorrect choices but also faster appropriate actions. We investigated the neural basis of this ability by recording neural activity in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys as they transitioned from puberty into adulthood. Across both age groups, behavior followed a characteristic pattern as a function of cue viewing time, with most trials resulting in errors if they were initiated shortly after stimulus appearance. However, reaction times were not correlated with the neural responses to the visual stimulus but to the activity of motor and visuomotor neurons that appeared after the initial response to the stimulus. Our results reveal the mechanisms that govern reaction times in response inhibitions task and the nature of maturation that prefrontal cortex undergoes between puberty and adulthood.</p>
