        <h1>Neural Data Analysis Pipelines for Extracting Information From C. elegans Microscopy Data</h1><h2>Amin Nejatbakhsh</h2><h3>Erdem Varol, Columbia University; Eviatar Yemini, Columbia University; Vivek Venkatachalam, Northeastern University; Albert Lin, Harvard University; Aravi Samuel, Harvard University; Oliver Hobert, Columbia University; Liam Paninski, Columbia University</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>C. elegans is a well-known model organism that has been widely used in neuroscience research to address variety of question ranging from developmental genetics to circuit-level neural dynamics. However, a significant analysis bottleneck remains the processing and the normalizing of the signal observed in highly variable microscopy data across the population of animals. Moreover, online experimental design is a critical scientific paradigm which necessitates the development of automated and scalable tools for analyzing a stream of data.

Motivated by these applications and recent advances in the field of computer vision and statistics we have developed automated and semi-automated pipelines for extracting information from C. elegans microscopy videos. On Monday, I will be presenting a summary of our progress divided in the following categories:

0) probabilistic inference for constructing a statistical atlas.
1) point set registration for aligning the atlas to an image.
2) permutation inference for probabilistic neuron assignments.
3) optimal transport for probabilistic segmentation and tracking.
4) matrix factorization for demixing calcium signals from deforming videos.

Categorizing the analysis techniques as a pipeline of atlas building, registration, segmentation and signal extraction is general and can be applied to virtually every single animal model and emerging imaging modality.
