        <h1>First-Gen In Neuro: Stories of Science From First-Generation Scholars</h1><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Science is a winding road of obstacles, struggles, and detours. However, the vast majority of the science we see is presented in its most pristine form. We see the published paper, the perfectly curated powerpoint, the tenure announcement, the notice of award. Rarely do we hear about the journey. In this event, a series of incredibly successful first-generation scholars will tell their personal stories in science. These brief talks will focus on how they became scientists, how they navigated the unfamiliar territory of academia, and the barriers they faced along the way. This will be followed by a panel discussion and Q&A session. These stories will uplift early-career scientists and amplify a community of scholars struggling through a system that is not structured for their success.
