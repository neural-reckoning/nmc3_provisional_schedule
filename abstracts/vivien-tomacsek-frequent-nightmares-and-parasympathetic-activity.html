        <h1>Frequent nightmares and parasympathetic activity reflected in increased heart rate during sleep</h1><h2>Vivien Tomacsek</h2><h3>Borbála Blaskovich, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Germany; Anna Király, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary; Richárd Reichardt, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary; Péter Simor, Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Nightmare Disorder, a parasomnia generally considered to be related to REM phase, is associated with vivid, emotionally dysphoric dreams commonly resulting in awakening and microarousals, experienced at least on a weekly basis. Poor subjective sleep quality is characterised by pathophysiological features such as abnormal arousal processes and sympathetic influences, which might lead to fragmented sleep. Dysfunctional parasympathetic regulation, especially before and during REM phases, brings about changes in the heart rate and its variability in subjects with Nightmare Disorder. We hypothesised that cardiac variability is attenuated in participants experiencing frequent nightmares as opposed to healthy control subjects during less deep sleep stages. Based on the second-nights’ polysomnographic recordings of 23 Nightmare Disordered (NM) and 29 control (CTL) subjects, we examined heart rate variability (HRV) during pre-REM, REM, post-REM and slow wave sleep periods, separately. In addition, two types of wakeful periods were also included in the analysis – besides resting state before sleep onset, ECG recordings of the participants during an emotional picture rating task were analysed. According to our results, a significant difference was found in the mean heart rate (HR) of the NM and CTL groups in the nocturnal segments but not during resting wakefulness before sleep onset, suggesting autonomic dysregulation, specifically during sleep in Nightmare Disorder. However, despite the accelerated heart rate in the NM subjects at night, they did not exhibit lower HRV. Our findings also show remarkable differences between the examined sleep stages regardless of the group, demonstrating major changes in the autonomic regulation throughout sleep. Regarding the emotional task, we also found a contrast between the NM and CTL subjects’ HR and HRV, which might indicate altered processes of emotion regulation in Nightmare Disorder.</p>
