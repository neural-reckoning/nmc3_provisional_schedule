support emotional, relative to neutral, memory. However, it is still unknown how these
two structures interact during successful encoding of unpleasant information. We used
direct intracranial recordings from 15 patients with medication-resistant epilepsy while
they encoded (day 1) and later retrieved (after 24 h, day 2) unpleasant and neutral
complex scenes from the IAPS database. All patients had intracranial depth electrodes
implanted into the amygdala and 8 patients also in the ipsilateral hippocampus.
Investigating the oscillatory responses associated with the subsequent memory of
scenes, we found that successful emotional memory formation produced in the
amygdala (n=8) a local broadband gamma activity (80-135 Hz) starting at around
400ms. By contrast, at around 500ms hippocampal (n=8) gamma responses (50-75 Hz)
were associated with successful encoding of both unpleasant and neutral scenes. We
further found theta oscillations in the amygdala influencing in a unidirectional way
hippocampus theta responses to emotional stimuli. Importantly, during successful
encoding of unpleasant scenes, the hippocampus gamma activity coupled to the
amygdala theta in a specific manner. We indeed found that the coupling occurred with a
consistent phase difference of ~1.67 radians during successful and unsuccessful
encoding of unpleasant scenes. Finally, using amplitude envelope cross-correlation as a
proxy of synchrony strength between the amygdala and the hippocampus we found
transient broadband gamma (60-120 Hz) connectivity. The amygdala gamma also leads
the hippocampus gamma during successful encoding of unpleasant scenes.
Our results show a unique phase code for negative memory formation in humans and
demonstrate that the amygdala facilitates memory encoding in the hippocampus within
a unique time window of ~37ms on which hippocampal gamma amplitude peaks have
to occur to form successfully emotional memories.</p>
