However, it is still unknown how these<br/>two structures interact during successful encoding of unpleasant information. We used<br/>direct intracranial recordings from 15 patients with medication-resistant epilepsy while<br/>they encoded (day 1) and later retrieved (after 24 h, day 2) unpleasant and neutral<br/>complex scenes from the IAPS database. All patients had intracranial depth electrodes<br/>implanted into the amygdala and 8 patients also in the ipsilateral hippocampus.<br/>Investigating the oscillatory responses associated with the subsequent memory of<br/>scenes, we found that successful emotional memory formation produced in the<br/>amygdala (n=8) a local broadband gamma activity (80-135 Hz) starting at around<br/>400ms. By contrast, at around 500ms hippocampal (n=8) gamma responses (50-75 Hz)<br/>were associated with successful encoding of both unpleasant and neutral scenes. We<br/>further found theta oscillations in the amygdala influencing in a unidirectional way<br/>hippocampus theta responses to emotional stimuli. Importantly, during successful<br/>encoding of unpleasant scenes, the hippocampus gamma activity coupled to the<br/>amygdala theta in a specific manner. We indeed found that the coupling occurred with a<br/>consistent phase difference of ~1.67 radians during successful and unsuccessful<br/>encoding of unpleasant scenes. Finally, using amplitude envelope cross-correlation as a<br/>proxy of synchrony strength between the amygdala and the hippocampus we found<br/>transient broadband gamma (60-120 Hz) connectivity. The amygdala gamma also leads<br/>the hippocampus gamma during successful encoding of unpleasant scenes.<br/>Our results show a unique phase code for negative memory formation in humans and<br/>demonstrate that the amygdala facilitates memory encoding in the hippocampus within<br/>a unique time window of ~37ms on which hippocampal gamma amplitude peaks have<br/>to occur to form successfully emotional memories.</p>
