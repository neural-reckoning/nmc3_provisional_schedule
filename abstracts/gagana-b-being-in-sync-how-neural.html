        <h1>Being in Sync: How Neural Entrainment Affects Attention and Conscious Experience</h1><h2>Gagana B</h2><h3>Deepak Padamata; Mahdi Mahdavi;</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Activation of attention-reward centres cause actual patterns of local field potentials across brain regions to become synchronised in their alpha, theta and gamma frequency bands but however, in recent years, research has been more focused on information filtering by partial synchronous spikes in neural populations. In this context, we further investigate the performance prediction estimates from neural synchronisation during the 2AFC task through analyses of power spectrums, time/frequency correlational metrics within and across brain regions, time lagged and phase based analysis of discrete brain wave structures and how these are can be reverse engineered to the respective brain state aka current conscious experience. Neural entrainment in turn has multitude of applications where (a) asychrony is attributed to Alzhimer's disease and Schizophrenia while (b) local network synchrony affects interpersonal communication (language understanding), learning experience (long-term working memory formation) and global fields or transient synchronous assemblies could underlie the basis of phenomenal consciousness where the NMDA-based plasticity, cortico-thalamic projections, and regular oscillatory waves knit with local diverse specialised brain module activity contributes to an integrated conscious experience. In this talk, we intend to explore discrete brain waves properties and associated mental states discussing the effect of synchronisation on consciousness while presenting our unique findings on mice models. </p>
