        <h1>Functional connectivity between right frontoparietal and visual networks is linked to visual processing speed</h1><h2>Adriana Ruiz-Rizzo</h2><h3> Svenja Küchenhoff, LMU Munich; Christian Sorg, TU Munich; Sebastian Schneider, TU Munich; Oliver Kohl, LMU Munich; Hermann J. Müller, LMU Munich; Kathrin Finke, Jena University Hospital</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>The neural theory of visual attention (TVA) proposes that visual processing speed depends on the coordinated activity between frontoparietal and occipital brain areas. Previous research has shown that the coordinated activity (i.e., functional connectivity, FC) between the cingulo-opercular network (COn) and the right-frontoparietal network (RFPn) is linked to individual visual processing speed. However, evidence for a link between visual processing speed and the inter-FC of COn and RFPn with visual networks is still lacking. Forty-eight healthy human adult participants underwent resting-state (rs-)fMRI and performed a whole-report psychophysical task. To obtain inter-FC, we analyzed rs-fMRI data within the entire frequency range possible for our data (i.e., 0.01-0.4 Hz) to avoid discarding meaningful neural information. Following previous approaches, we examined the data in separate frequency bins (Hz): Slow-5 (0.01-0.027), Slow-4 (0.027-0.073), Slow-3 (0.073-0.198), and Slow-2 (0.198-0.4). We used the mathematical framework of TVA to estimate an individual, latent-level visual processing speed parameter. We found that the inter-FC between RFPn and visual networks was negatively associated with visual processing speed in Slow-5 and Slow-2, with no corresponding significant association for the inter-FC between COn and visual networks. These results provide first empirical evidence for an association of inter-FC at rest between RFPn and visual networks with the visual processing speed parameter. These findings suggest a direct influence on occipital regions from the right frontoparietal, but not frontoinsular, regions, to support visual processing speed.</p>
