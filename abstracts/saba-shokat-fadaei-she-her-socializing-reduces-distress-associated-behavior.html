        <h1>Socializing reduces distress-associated behavior in mice</h1><h2>Saba Shokat Fadaei (She, Her)</h2><h3>Haohan  Wei, New York University ; Ayo Adewakun, New York University ;  Robert C. Froemke , New York University School of Medicine ; Jhimmy Talbot, New York University; Dan Littman, New York University </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation is a shared symptom for most neurodegenerative diseases. One of the harmful outcomes of presence of LPS in the brain is the cognitive impairment which is a result of a downstream inflammatory responses that had been initiated in the gut.
In animal models these cognitive impairments include lethargy, arched or curled body posture, inactivity, and reduced consumption. Socialization in animals is positively correlated with physical and mental, learning, and reduced mortality. The main goal of this study is to investigate if socialization through co-housing has a direct therapeutic effect on LPS induced neuroinflammation.
We utilized an LPS-induced endotoxemia model for our experiments. A total of 24 mice C57/BL6 mice were divided into two groups: socially isolated mice or co-housed mice.
Continuous seventy-two hours recording sessions were performed and videos were analyzed and scored. We found that co-housing mice not only reduced the recovery time but also decreased the duration of exhibition of the sickness behavior. Analysis showed that the single-housed mice displays sickness behavior, including extended hunched posture, for about thirty-five minutes following the LPS injection, while the co-house mice only spent twelve minutes displaying sickness behavior. In addition, there was a significant weigh loss in the LPS injected mice. Motion tracking analysis revealed that socially isolated LPS injected mice remained stationary for hours compared to co-housed mice. 
In conclusion, our findings show that co-housing mice post endotoxemia endotoxemia demonstrate therapeutic which could be further exploited for translational studies.
