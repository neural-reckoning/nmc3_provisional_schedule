sleep-like activity. LS has been associated with deficits in sustained attention (SA) but the
causal involvement of LS in attentional lapses remain unclear. This study aimed at addressing
this knowledge gap by directly manipulating LS and SA through pharmacological means. In a
double-blind, randomised-control trial, 32 participants received methylphenidate,
atomoxetine, citalopram or placebo during four separate experimental sessions. During each
session, electroencephalography measured LS whilst participants completed a visual SA task.
Methylphenidate, which increases wake-promoting noradrenaline and dopamine, decreased
LS and improved performance (lower reaction time (RT), and less misses). Atomoxetine,
which increases noradrenaline, decreased LS but increased RT. Conversely, citalopram,
which increases sleep-promoting serotonin, increased LS and RT. Mediation analysis
confirmed the causal relationship of LS on SA. These results suggest that LS could represent
a mechanism for the effect of fatigue on attention.</p>
