        <h1>Predictive mechanisms are involved in perceptual stability across saccades</h1><h2>Anne-Sophie Laurin</h2><h3>Anne-Sophie Laurin, University of Montreal, Department of Psychology; Maxime Bleau, University of Montreal, School of Optometry; Jessica Gedjakouchian, University of Montreal, School of Optometry; Romain Fournet, University of Montreal, School of Optometry; Laure Pisella, ImpAct, INSERM UM1028, CNRS UMR 5292, University Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Aarlenne Zein Khan, University of Montreal, School of Optometry. </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>It has been suggested that perceptual stability across saccades relies on predictive mechanisms. Specifically, predictions of what should occur after the saccade modulate our perception of the visual scene once the saccade has been executed.<br/>To investigate this, we measured how perceptual discrimination of a visual target at a peripheral location before saccading to it, is influenced by changes in the visual scene after the saccade. Participantsâ€™ task was to discriminate a symbol at a peripheral location, before saccading to it. We manipulated information in the visual scene after the saccade in various ways (removal, change in identity or shifts). Because changes after the saccade were irrelevant to the task, we hypothesized that changes in discrimination performance, if any, could only be attributable to disrupted comparisons between our pre-saccadic expectation and our post-saccadic perception of the visual scene. We observed that the disappearance of the saccade goal target, without the disappearance of the surrounding stimuli, reduced the discrimination performance compared to baseline. Importantly, discrimination performance remained unchanged when the entire visual scene, including or excluding the saccade goal target, was removed. These results support the idea that discrimination decreases are not due to abrupt changes affecting memory of the target. It also suggests that removal of the visual scene does not disrupt predictive mechanisms, likely because changes are correctly attributed to the external world. <br/>We also observed that shifts in the position of the saccade goal target after the saccade disrupted discrimination performance to a much greater degree when the position shifted outside the distribution of saccade endpoints both parallel and perpendicular to the target. This supports the notion of predictive mechanisms taking saccade-related motor noise into account when comparing pre- and post- visual target information, thus involved in the perception of a visual scene across saccades. </p>
