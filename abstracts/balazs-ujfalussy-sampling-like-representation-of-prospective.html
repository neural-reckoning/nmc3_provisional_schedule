        <h1>Sampling-like representation of prospective locations during hippocampal theta sequences.</h1><h2>Balázs Ujfalussy</h2><h3>Gergő Orbán, Computational Systems Neuroscience Lab, Wigner Research Center for Physics, Budapest, Hungary</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Predicting the possible future consequences of actions is necessary for efficient planning. In volatile or partially observed environments animals can capitalise on representing the uncertainty associated with those predictions. Representation of and computations with uncertainty has recently gained support in a wide range of cognitive phenomena but whether and how uncertainty is represented in navigation and planning has remained elusive. Here we investigated the neuronal representation emerging in a  goal-oriented spatial navigation task in a neuron population recorded from the hippocampus, a region widely implicated in model-based planning. <br/><br/>During exploratory behavior the hippocampal population activity repeatedly outlines the trajectory of the animal starting from its recent past towards its possible future positions within each theta cycle (theta sequences). Critically, during a single cycle the uncertainty is expected to increase systematically, thus providing an opportunity to identify how it is encoded in the population activity. We contrasted 4 alternative models: (a) encoding only the most likely trajectory (no uncertainty encoded); (b) encoding the uncertainty by sampling from the distribution of possible trajectories (uncertainty encoded across theta cycles); (c) representing uncertainty via the standard probabilistic population coding (PPC) or (d) via distributed distributional code (DDC).<br/><br/>By decoding hippocampal spikes falling into different phases of the theta oscillation, we confirmed that the location encoded by the activity sweeps ahead of the animal at late theta phases. Consistent with the representation of increased uncertainty, we observed that place fields were largest when estimated from late phase spikes. The population activity typically encoded single locations instead of full distributions with the firing rate being the highest when encoding future locations ruling out distributional population codes (PPC and DDC). Finally, we found that the variability between subsequent theta cycles is larger than that expected from encoding the most likely trajectory, and is consistent with sampling from hypothetical future trajectories.  <br/><br/>Our analysis, being the first to directly contrast alternative frameworks of probabilistic computations, also demonstrates that activity in the hippocampus represents uncertainty and therefore is well equipped to contribute to optimal planning.</p>
