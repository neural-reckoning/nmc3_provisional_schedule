        <h1>Fully implantable wireless and battery-free neuromodulation tools</h1><h2>Philipp Gutruf</h2><h3>Philipp Gutruf, University of Arizona</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Recent advances in materials and optoelectronic concepts for the creation of soft electronics coupled with miniaturization of wireless energy harvesting schemes enable the creation of highly capable neuromodulation tools with sizes, shapes and physical properties matched to biological systems. This seamless integration enables a new class of implants with access to the central and peripheral nervous system and vital organs. Here we present a new class of tools that provide unparalleled capabilities to asses and modulate organ function and enable new experimental paradigms in a range of complex environments and contexts that cannot be explored with conventional technologies. The devices feature miniaturized form factor and technologies that are rapidly scalable to enable broad dissemination while still maintaining compatibility with noninvasive imaging technologies such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically, we will highlight 1. Current advances in highly miniaturized wireless and battery free photometric recording devices that enable the study of neural dynamics in in ethnologically relevant environments even in young animal models unlocking new experimental paradigms to uncover the working principles of the developing brain. 2. Wireless battery-free and subdermally optogenetic stimulation tools that enable: neural activation in freely flying birds; transcranial optogenetic stimulation in mice without cranial surgery; long range neural activation in ethologically relevant environments. 3. Wireless battery free and subdermally implantable electrical interfaces to the spinal and muscular system. Combined these platforms for small animal models enable exploratory neuroscience with minimal impact on the test subject and quantitively expand experimental paradigms.</p>
