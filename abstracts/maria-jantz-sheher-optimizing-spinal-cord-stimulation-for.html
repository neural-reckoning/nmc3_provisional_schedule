        <h1>Optimizing spinal cord stimulation for bladder control using evoked nerve and muscle responses</h1><h2>Maria Jantz (she/her)</h2><h3>Chaitanya Gopinath, University of Pittsburgh Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; Ritesh Kumar, University of Pittsburgh Department of Bioengineering; Robert Gaunt, University of Pittsburgh Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Bladder dysfunction is widespread and has a substantial impact on daily life, but effective management strategies remain elusive. Using neurostimulation, it may be possible to recruit the sensorimotor reflexes that control the lower urinary tract and thereby restore bladder function. Epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has clinical precedent for treating back pain, and we have previously shown that it can target the bladder by selectively recruiting lower urinary tract afferents. Additionally, we have effectively produced both inhibition and excitation of bladder contractions. However, the optimal stimulation parameters to evoke voiding or continence can span a wide space, including amplitude, frequency, and stimulation location, and these factors often vary between subjects. Here, we investigate the relationship of stimulation-evoked muscle and nerve activity with evoked bladder pressure changes. 

We placed high-density SCS electrode arrays (MicroLeads Inc, Ripple LLC) to stimulate the sacral spinal cord in cats. To record stimulation-evoked activity on lower urinary tract afferents, we placed nerve cuffs on the pelvic nerve, the pudendal nerve and its branches, as well as the sciatic nerve. To measure muscle activation, we recorded electromyographic (EMG) activity from the external urethral sphincter, external anal sphincter, and the gluteal muscle. Using a catheter in the bladder, we recorded changes in pressure. 

We extracted features from the nerve cuff and EMG recordings, including peak to peak amplitude, time of maximum and minimum amplitudes, length of response, and mean absolute value of several time bins of the recording. After performing a principal component analysis, we determined that it is often possible to distinguish electrodes that do not produce a functional response from those that do, as well as separate the continence and voiding responses based on neural activity. </p>
