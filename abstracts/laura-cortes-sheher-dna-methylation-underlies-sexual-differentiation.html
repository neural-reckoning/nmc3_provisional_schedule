        <h1>DNA Methylation Underlies Sexual Differentiation of Cell Type in the Brain </h1><h2>Laura Cortes (She/Her)</h2><h3>Carla Cisternas, Georgia State; Damian Mason, Georgia State; Iagn Kenji Cabahug, Georgia State; Nancy Forger, Georgia State </h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Most animals display sex-specific behaviors, such as mating, aggression and parental care, that are important for the continuation of the species. These behaviors are controlled by sexually dimorphic groups of neurons that are defined by their gene expression (i.e., neurochemical phenotype) in certain brain areas. Within several hypothalamic regions, for example, females have more neurons that express estrogen receptor alpha (ERùõº) and kisspeptin than do males. Little is known regarding the biological processes that cause these sex differences to develop, but our research suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play a role. Expression of epigenetic enzymes that place and remove methyl marks is highest during the first week of life in the hypothalamus and differs by sex. This suggests that DNA methylation is a critical mechanism underlying sex differences in brain development. In addition, we find that inhibiting DNA methylation neonatally by injecting zebularine into the cerebral ventricles abolishes sex differences in the number of ERùõº cells at weaning in three hypothalamic areas: the preoptic area (POA), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and arcuate nucleus (ARC). Interestingly, however, zebularine disrupts sex differences differently in each brain area. In the POA and VMH, zebularine treatment increases ERùõº labeling in males to female-like levels, while in the ARC, zebularine decreases ERùõº labeling in females to male-like levels. Effects of zebularine on kisspeptin also differs by region: in the anteroventral periventricular region, kisspeptin cell number is unaffected by inhibition of DNA methylation, but kisspeptin labeling in the ARC is reduced in females after zebularine treatment. Finally, we recently tested the role of demethylating enzymes on sex differences in neurochemical phenotype. We find that early-life knock-down of Tet2 and Tet3 feminizes (i.e., increases) ERùõº labeling in the ARC of males. Thus, both DNA methylation and demethylation early in life sculpt sex differences in cell type in the hypothalamus.</p>
