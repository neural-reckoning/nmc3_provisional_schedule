        <h1>A miniature microscope  for neuro + vascular imaging in freely moving animals</h1><h2>Janaka Senarathna</h2><h3>Nitish V. Thakor; Arvind P. Pathak</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Imaging multiple variables that characterize brain function in neuroscientific and preclinical animal models permits a better understanding of neurophysiology and its disruption in disease. However, multi-variable imaging systems need to acquire images with multiple contrasts, and therefore require inclusion of many optical components which make them large and stationary. Moreover, such systems are often custom designed, expensive, and restrict experimentation due to the need for anesthesia or animal head fixation. To overcome these challenges, we developed a portable, low-cost, miniature optical microscope capable of imaging three optical contrasts over a 3x3 mm2 field of view at 5 µm resolution. The microscope consists of a fluorescence (FL) channel for imaging neural activity (e.g. via GCaMP) or fluorescently tagged cells (e.g. 9L-GFP cancer cells); an intrinsic optical signal (IOS) channel for imaging hemoglobin absorption (i.e. cerebral blood volume); and a laser speckle contrast (LSC) channel for imaging perfusion (i.e. cerebral blood flow). Weighing 3g after strain relief, it can be used to conduct neuroimaging in freely behaving mice. 

First we compared images acquired via the miniature microscope for each channel with those acquired from a non-miniaturized imaging system, and demonstrated a high degree of correlation. We then used it to interrogate neurovascular coupling in an awake mouse auditory cortex in relation to two distinct sound stimuli at 4 kHz and 24 kHz, and characterized the unique spatial and temporal relationship between neuronal, vasodilatory and blood flow responses to each stimuli. We also used our microscope to investigate in vivo the progression of a brain tumor throughout the tumor’s life-cycle and mapped the stages of angiogenesis and the establishment of patent blood flow within the tumor microenvironment. 

We are working on the next generation of our microscope and looking for strategic partners to enable exciting discoveries in both basic neuroscience and preclinical research.
