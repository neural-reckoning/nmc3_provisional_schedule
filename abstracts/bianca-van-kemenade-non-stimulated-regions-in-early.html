        <h1>Non-stimulated regions in early visual cortex encode the contents of conscious visual perception</h1><h2>Bianca van Kemenade</h2><h3>Gregor Wilbertz, Department of Psychology, Freie Universität Berlin; Annalena Müller, Department of Experimental and Biological Psychology, University of Potsdam; Philipp Sterzer, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charité Campus Mitte, Berlin</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Predictions shape our perception. The theory of predictive processing poses that our brains make sense of incoming sensory input by generating predictions, which are sent back from higher to lower levels of the processing hierarchy. These predictions are based on our internal model of the world and enable inferences about the hidden causes of the sensory input data. It has been proposed that conscious perception corresponds to the currently most probable internal model of the world. Accordingly, predictions influencing conscious perception should be fed back from higher to lower levels of the processing hierarchy. An elegant way to isolate effects of feedback signalling in the human brain is to measure neural activity in regions of retinotopic visual cortex that do not receive feedforward input. For example, previous fMRI studies have shown that non-stimulated parts of early visual cortex contain content-specific information from the surrounding visual context, most likely mediated by feedback signalling. Here, we asked whether the actual contents of conscious visual perception would also be reflected by neural signals in non-stimulated regions of early visual cortex. In our fMRI experiment, participants viewed large-field ambiguous visual motion stimuli that spared a subregion of the visual field. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI signals, we could decode the participants’ reported perception not only from stimulated regions of early visual cortex, but also from non-stimulated subregions. These results indicate that early sensory cortices in the human brain receive predictive feedback signals that reflect the current contents of conscious perception. </p>
