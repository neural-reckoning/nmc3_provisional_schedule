        <h1>Pulvinar input to visual cortex scrambles direction selectivity during saccades</h1><h2>Satoru Miura</h2><h3>Massimo Scanziani</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Sensory stimuli are often generated by the animal’s own movements. Many sensory systems suppress these self-induced inputs and selectively respond to externally generated stimuli, thereby maintaining the perceptual stability of the external world. Rapid eye movement, called saccades, generates motion of the visual scene on the retina. Several mechanisms have been proposed that prevent the perception of such motion. Yet, how they are implemented in the circuitry of visual cortex is poorly understood. Here, we focused on the mouse primary visual cortex (V1), where many neurons encode the motion direction of visual stimuli. We began by comparing the response of V1 neurons to spontaneous saccades with their response to external visual stimuli designed to mimic the motion of visual scene induced by saccades, which we termed “pseudo-saccades”. Many neurons showed direction selectivity for saccades (i.e., responded differently to saccades moving in opposite directions) as well as for pseudo-saccades. Interestingly, however, there was no correlation between the direction selectivity for the two conditions. Consequently, a downstream decoder that discriminates the direction of pseudo-saccades based on the population activity in V1 is unable to discriminate the direction of visual motion induced by actual saccades. Thus, in V1, direction selectivity is scrambled during saccades, and information about the direction of motion is suppressed. Where does this scrambling originate from? We discovered that V1 receives a non-visual input from the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus around the time of saccades. To determine whether this pulvinar input mediates the scrambling, we pharmacologically silenced the pulvinar. Upon silencing this thalamic nucleus, the direction selectivity for real saccades and pseudo-saccades became correlated. Thus, the pulvinar suppresses saccade-induced motion of the visual scene in V1 by scrambling direction selectivity. </p>
