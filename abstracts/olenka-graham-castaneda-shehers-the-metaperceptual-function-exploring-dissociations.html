        <h1>The metaperceptual function: Exploring dissociations between confidence and task performance with type 2 psychometric curves</h1><h2>Olenka Graham Castaneda (she/hers)</h2><h3>Brian Maniscalco, Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California Irvine; Olenka Graham Castaneda, Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California Irvine; Brian Odegaard, Department of Psychology, University of Florida; Jorge Morales, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Johns Hopkins University ; Sivananda Rajananda, Department of Bioengineering, University of California Riverside; Megan A. K. Peters, Department of Cognitive Sciences, University of California Irvine</h3><h2>Abstract</h1><p>Reports of confidence do not always correlate with perceptual accuracy. This dissociation suggests that distinct computational and neural processes underlie these functions. Recent investigations have therefore sought to experimentally isolate metacognitive processes by creating conditions where perceptual sensitivity is matched but confidence differs (“matched-performance / different-confidence”; MPDC). Although MPDC has been successfully implemented in recent studies, much remains unknown about its underlying causes or how to best induce these effects in experimental settings. Here we developed a principled approach to comprehensively characterizing MPDC effects through analyzing metaperceptual (i.e., type 2 psychometric) functions relating objective performance to subjective confidence across widely varying performance levels and experimental manipulations. We found that MPDC effect magnitude depends on stimulus properties, observers’ sensitivity level, and critically on trial type order (blocked or interleaved across stimulus property variations). Our findings provide the first comprehensive exploration of MPDC effects, offer a prescriptive guide to quantitative metaperceptual analysis, and suggest optimal experimental paradigms for experimentally isolating metacognition and awareness in future studies.
